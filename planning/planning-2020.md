2020 presentation planning - version 0.5

Hi

I am planing to do some presentations this year, related to networking and security.
New this year I will instead of doing the workshops in class I will mostly present, and then reference a booklet with exercises which participants can do later on their own or at hacker days.

Scheduled hacker days will be an option where people can meet up and play with the subjects discussed 10:00-17:00. Joining a hacker day will give them more time and they can work at an individual pace.

Two days planned for weekend at BornHack, saturday and sunday, but Network village will be available during all of BornHack.

Two days planned for two saturdays in november or december suggested, after the presentation evenings.


# Practical exercises
The presentations will include references to exercises booklets for each of the presentations. These contain exercises describing in detail the techniques used. The practitioner will benefit from doing these after each presentation.

Community we will create a common LinkedIn group for these to allow people to both network, and discuss the exercises and related subjects.




## Template, each presentation should have this text added:

Bringing a laptop is not required, but welcome. Exercises booklet will be referenced, but it is expected that participants will do them on their own later or at the scheduled hacker days.

The hacker days will be announced in the event calendar and also take place during BornHack in the network warrior village.



## TCP/IP Network Basics
This presentation is a walk-through of the basic protocols used in internets today. The contents will cover from lower level ARP and NDP and all the way to working modern networks with IPv4 and IPv6. Examples configuration and tools will be shown on Raspberry Pi with Debian.

Example packets will be shown in Wireshark.

Target audience, anyone interested in networking.
