\chapter*{Hand-in 1: Pentest a network and deliver pentest report}

{\bf Assignment:}\\
Pentest a network - with at least some results.
Select one which you are allowed to port scan and one which is not highly critical for you.

I recommend using Nmap with scripts.

Create a report, use the report template for inspiration.

The report should include the following sections at least:
\begin{list2}
\item Title, Table of contents, formal report thanks
\item Confidentiality agreement -- Write "Confidential" on each page
\item Executive summary -- big companies always want this
\item Information about the scan done, what was it
\item Scope and targets
\item Review of all targets -- detailed information and recommendations
\item Conclusion -- may be more technical
\item Appendices -- various information, Whois info about subnets and prefixes
\end{list2}

You are very much welcome to run multiple tools! If you find web servers run Nikto, if you think there are network devices, try SNMP walk.

Must be handed in as PDF on Fronter and latest on November 16, 2021 23:59 . Teams up to two are allowed. Make sure to list team members in the report.

Expect PDF as A4, portrait mode up to 5-10 pages with illustrations as needed. Double if team.

Recommend to use a report template with table of contents, front matter, page numbers etc.


Help:\\
Think about what you would like to receive if you were responsible for security in the network examined.
