## Network Security Basics

A blue-team introduction to Communication and Network Security

This presentation will present challenges in network security and the
basic tools for countering threats. We will introduce the encryption
protocols in use in networks for Virtual Private Network (VPN) and
Transport Layer Services (TLS).

Network segmentation will be discussed with examples from Zeek Security Monitor
for getting information about flows and how tools like Firewalls, Access Control Lists (ACL)
and VLANs can help reduce risk for the network.


The presentation will contain excerpts from my Communication and
Network Security 10 ECTS course, which is open source.

Target audience, anyone interested in network security.

Duration: 4 hours

Keywords: Encryption, TLS, VPN, VLAN IEEE 802.1q, Wifi security, IEEE
