\end{list2}


\slide{About equipment and exercises}

\begin{list2}
\item Bringing a laptop to my courses is not required, but welcome
\item Links etc. are in the slides and open source licensed, PDFs
\item Exercises booklets are available for many of my courses, see Github\\
but it is expected that participants will do any exercises on their own later or at the scheduled hacker days
\item The hacker days will be announced in various places

\item Events like BornHack are excellent places to arrange hacker days in the network warrior village, or other places
\end{list2}

\slide{Course Materials}

\begin{list1}
\item This material is in multiple parts:
\begin{list2}
%\item Introduktionsmateriale med baggrundsinformation
\item Slide shows - presentation - this file
\item Exercises - PDF files in my repository
\end{list2}
\item Links
\begin{list2}
\item All materials will be released as open source at:\\
\link{https://github.com/kramse/security-courses/}
\item Additional resources from the internet linked from lecture plans:\\
\link{https://zencurity.gitbook.io/kea-it-sikkerhed/}
\end{list2}

\slide{Hackerlab Setup}

\hlkimage{7cm}{hacklab-1.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Hardware: modern laptop CPU with virtualisation\\
Dont forget to enable hardware virtualisation in the BIOS
\item Software Host OS: Windows, Mac, Linux

\end{list2}



\slide{Networking Hardware}

If you want to do exercises and work with networks \\
It will be an advantage to have a wireless USB network card and an USB Ethernet card.

The following are two models I have used:
\begin{list2}
\item TP-link TL-WN722N hardware version 2.0 cheap
\item Alfa AWUS036ACH 2.4GHz + 5GHz Dual-Band and high performing
\item Often you need to compile drivers yourself, and research a bit
\end{list2}

Getting an USB card allows you to use the regular one for the main OS, and insert the USB into the virtual machine



\slide{Network Management}

\begin{quote}
Network management is the process of administering and managing computer networks. Services provided by this discipline include fault analysis, performance management, provisioning of networks and maintaining the quality of service. Software that enables network administrators to perform their functions is called network management software.\\
\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_management}

\end{list2}
\end{list1}

RFC-1958:
\begin{quote}
 A good analogy for the development of the Internet is that of
 constantly renewing the individual streets and buildings of a city,
 rather than razing the city and rebuilding it. The architectural
 principles therefore aim to provide a framework for creating
 cooperation and standards, as a small "spanning set" of rules that
 generates a large, varied and evolving space of technology.

\slide{Basic test tools TCP - Ping and Traceroute}

We should all know
\begin{list2}
\item \verb+ping+ -- like sending a radar ping, anything there
\item \verb+traceroute+ (windows tracert) -- find the route packets traverse
\end{list2}

and add these!
\begin{list2}
\item \verb+Wireshark+ -- sniffing and disecting traffic
\item \verb+Nmap+ and \verb+Nping+ -- port scan and advanced ping program with TCP/UDP!
\end{list2}


\slide{Ping}

\begin{alltt}
\small {\bfseries
$ ping 192.168.1.1}
PING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=150 time=8.849 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=150 time=0.588 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=150 time=0.553 ms
\end{alltt}


\begin{list1}
\item ICMP -- Internet Control Message Protocol
\item ECHO -- only ICMP message that generates another
\item ICMP ECHO request sent, and ICMP ECHO reply expected
\item Same with IPv6, \verb+ping6+
\end{list1}

Fun fact: A problem with say TCP or UDP can be reported with ICMP, but ICMP ECHO is the only ICMP message that will result in an ICMP response. No black storms started with ICMP.

\slide{traceroute}

\slide{Note About Hardware IPv4 checksum offloading}

\begin{list1}
\item IPv4 checksum must be calculated for every packet received
\item IPv4 checksum must be calculated for every packet sent\\
Usually on a router the Time To Live is decremented, to need re-calculation
\vskip 1cm
\item Let an ASIC chip on the network card do the work!
\item Most server network chips today support this and more
\item Benefit for performance, but beware when using security tools
\item If every packet in wireshark has wrong checksum, its the network card doing it
\item Can be turned off, when doing security work

\slide{Step 1: configure devices properly}

\begin{slidelist}
\item You should always configure your devices properly
\item Use Secure Shell (SSH)
\item Configure NTP
\item Turn on SNMP, probably SNMPv3
\item Turn on LLDP Link Layer Discovery Protocol -- vendor-neutral\\
{\small\link{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Layer_Discovery_Protocol}}
\item Configure centralized syslog
\item Updated firmware, HTTPS and SSH only etc. the usual stuff
\vskip 1 cm
\item Having a minimum template of configuration options is a great starting point
\end{slidelist}

Then use Oxidized and LibreNMS


\slide{Oxidized}

\begin{list2}
\item Oxidized is written in Ruby as a replacement for RANCID (Perl)
\item Very easy to get running
\item Fetches and imports configurations into Git repository, or others
\item RESTful API, Web Interface, and command line tools
\item \link{https://github.com/ytti/oxidized}

\slide{Centralized management SSH, Jump hosts}

\begin{quote}
A jump server, jump host or jumpbox is a computer on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone. The most common example is managing a host in a DMZ from trusted networks or computers.
\end{quote}

\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server}

Advantage, you can configure this server/system to only allow Key based logins -- eliminate the possibility for brute-force attacks succeeding

\slide{OpenSSH client config with jump host}

My recommended SSH client settings, put in \verb+$HOME/.ssh/config+:
\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
Host *
    ServerAliveInterval=30
    ServerAliveCountMax=30
    NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes
    HashKnownHosts yes
    UseRoaming no

Host jump-01
  Hostname 10.1.2.3
  Port 12345678

Host fw-site-01 10.1.2.5
  User hlk
  Port 34
  Hostname 10.1.2.5
  ProxyCommand ssh -q -a -x jump-01 -W %h:%p
\end{alltt}

I configure fw using both hostname and IP,\\
then I can use name, and any program using IP get this config too



\slide{Ansible}

\hlkimage{2cm}{Ansible_logo.png}

\begin{quote}
From my course materials:\\
Ansible is great for automating stuff, so by running the playbooks we can get a whole lot of programs installed, files modified - avoiding the Vi editor.
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Easy to read, even if you don't know much about YAML
\item \link{https://www.ansible.com/} and \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)}
\item Great documentation\\
 \link{https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/apt_module.html}
\end{list2}


\slide{Ansible Dependencies}

\hlkimage{10cm}{python-logo.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Ansible based on Python, only need Python installed\\
\link{https://www.python.org/}
\item Often you use Secure Shell for connecting to servers\\
\link{https://www.openssh.com/}
\item Easy to configure SSH keys, for secure connections
\item Can use sudo or doas commands for root access when needed
\end{list2}


\slide{How Ansible Works: inventory files}

List your hosts in one or multiple text files:
\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
[all:vars]
ansible_ssh_port=34443

[office]
fw-01 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.1 ansible_ssh_port=22 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/local/bin/python

[infrastructure]
smtp-01     ansible_ssh_host=192.0.2.10 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/local/bin/python
vpnmon-01   ansible_ssh_host=10.50.60.18

\end{alltt}

\begin{list2}
\item Inventory files specify the hosts we work with
\item Linux and OpenBSD servers shown here
\item Real inventory for a site with development and staging may be 500 lines
\item office and infrastructure are group names
\end{list2}


\slide{How Ansible Works: ad hoc commands }

Using the inventory file you can run commands with Ansible:

\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
  ansible -m ping new-server
  ansible -a "date" new-server
  ansible -m shell -a "grep a /etc/something" new-server
\end{alltt}

\begin{list2}
\item Running commands on multiple servers is easy now
\item This alone has value in itself
\item Checking settings on servers
\item Making small changes to servers
\item Then playbooks can automate your work!
\end{list2}


\slide{How Ansible Works: Playbooks}

The benefit comes with tasks listed in playbooks -- example playbook content, installing software using APT:
\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
apt:
    name: "\{\{ packages \}\}"
    vars:
      packages:
        - nmap
        - curl
        - iperf
        ...
\end{alltt}

Running it:
\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
cd kramse-labs/suricatazeek
ansible-playbook -v 1-dependencies.yml 2-suricatazeek.yml 3-elasticstack.yml
\end{alltt}
Installs a full server with Elasticsearch, Kibana, Zeek and Suricata in 10 minutes

\slide{Python and YAML -- Git}

\hlkimage{7cm}{git-logo.png}

\begin{list2}
\item We need to store configurations
\item Run playbooks
\item Problem: Remember what we did, when, how
\item Solution: use git for the playbooks
\item Not the only version control system, but my preferred one
\end{list2}


\slide{How Ansible Works: typical execution}

\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
ansible-playbook -i hosts.cph1 -K infrastructure-firewalls.yml -t pf.conf --check --diff

ansible-playbook -i hosts.cph1 -K infrastructure-firewalls.yml -t pf.conf

ansible-playbook -i hosts.cph1 -K infrastructure-nagios.yml -t config-only

ansible-playbook -i smartboxes -K create-pf-conf.yml -l smartbox-xxx-01
\end{alltt}

\begin{list2}
\item Pro tip: check before you push out changes to production networks \smiley
\item Check will see if something needs changing
\item Diff will show the changes about to be made
\item Having configuration in Git improves things a lot!
\end{list2}




\slide{Get ready, Up and running with Ansible}

Prequisites for Ansible - you need a Linux machine:
\begin{list2}
\item python language - Ansible uses this
\item ssh keys - remote login without passwords
\item Sudo - allow regular users to do superuser tasks
\item Recommended tool: \verb+ssh-copy-id+ for getting your key on new server
\item Recommended Change: \verb+sshd_config+ - no passwords allowed, no bruteforce
\item Recommended to use: jump hosts/ProxyCommand in \verb+ssh_config+

\slide{SIEM and logging systems}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}\small
You could {\bf buy a bunch of expensive gear}, point it all to a {\bf log management} or a {\bf security incident and event management (SIEM)} system, and let it automatically tell you what it knows. Some incident response teams may start this way, but unfortunately, many never evolve. {\bf Working only with what the SIEM tells you}, versus what you have configured it to tell you {\bf based on your contextual data}, will invariably fail. Truly demonstrating {\bf value} from security monitoring and incident response {\bf requires a major effort}. As with all projects, {\bf planning} is the most important phase. {\bf Designing} an approach that works best for you requires significant effort up front, but offers a great payout later in the form of {\bf meaningful incident response and overall improved security}.

\item I recommend pre-filtering, see what noise your devices \emph{would send}\\
"Collecting only relevant data can have a direct impact on reducing costs as well."
\item Same is recommended in CIP page 50: Just the Facts

\item CIP 7 Tools of the Trade, need to know NetFlow, DNS, and HTTP proxy logs in the real-world
\begin{list2}
\item Defense in Depth -- we will never catch everything
\item Log Management: The Security Event Data Warehouse
\item Intrusion Detection Isn’t Dead
\item DNS, the One True King -- Logging and analyzing DNS transactions, Blocking DNS requests or responses
\item HTTP Is the Platform: Web Proxies -- Web proxies allow you to solve additional security problems
\item Rolling Packet Capture -- In a perfect world, we would have full packet capture everywhere
\end{list2}
\end{list1}



\slide{Detection Capabilities}


Security incidents happen, but what happens. One of the actions to reduce impact of incidents are done in preparing for incidents.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Preparation} for an attack, establish procedures and mechanisms for detecting and responding to attacks
\end{itemize}

Preparation will enable easy {\bf identification} of affected systems, better {\bf containment} which systems are likely to be infected, {\bf eradication} what happened -- how to do the {\bf eradication} and {\bf recovery}.

\slide{Strategy for implementing identification and detection}

We recommend that the following strategy is used for implementing identification and detection.

We have the following recommendations and actions points for logging:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\faSquareO] Enable system logging from servers
\item[\faSquareO] Enable system logging from network devices
\item[\faSquareO] Centralize logging
\item[\faSquareO] Add search facilities and dashboards
\item[\faSquareO] Perform system audits manually or automatically
\item[\faSquareO] Setup notification and notification procedures
\end{enumerate}

\slide{Extended Sources}
When a basic logging infrastructure is setup, it can be expanded to increase coverage, by
adding more sources:

\begin{list2}
\item DNS query logging -- will enable multiple cases to be resolved, example malware identification and tracing, when was a malware domain queried, when was the first infection
\item Session data from Firewalls, Netflow -- traffic patterns can be investigated and both attacks and cases like exfiltration can likely be seen
\end{list2}

Hint: Take the sources available first, make a proof-of-concept, expand coverage

\slide{Data Analysis Skills}

\begin{quote}
Although we could spend an entire book creating an exhaustive list of skills needed to be a good security data scientist, this chapter covers the following skills/domains that a data scientist will benefit from
knowing within information security:
\begin{list2}
\item Domain expertise—Setting and maintaining a purpose to the analysis
\item Data management—Being able to prepare, store, and maintain data
\item Programming—The glue that connects data to analysis
\item Statistics—To learn from the data
\item Visualization—Communicating the results effectively
\end{list2}
It might be easy to label any one of these skills as the most important, but in reality, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Each of these contributes a significant and important piece to the workings of
security data science.
