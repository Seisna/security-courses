\slide{The concept of Intrusion Detection}

Denning, Dorothy E., "An Intrusion Detection Model," Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May 1986, pages 119–131

\begin{quote}
Dorothy Elizabeth Denning, born August 12, 1945, is a US-American information security researcher known for lattice-based access control (LBAC), intrusion detection systems (IDS), and other cyber security innovations. She published four books and over 200 articles. Inducted into the National Cyber Security Hall of Fame in 2012, she is now Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Defense Analysis, Naval Postgraduate School.

\slide{Why spend time on IDS}

You have malware on a system?!

\hlkrightimage{4cm}{hackers_JOLIE+1995.jpg}

\begin{list2}
\item You have identified {\bf one system}
\item And perhaps even the strain of malware -- nice!
\end{list2}

but what are the next steps? Natural questions are:
\begin{list2}
\item Which other systems are infected?
\item What is the timeline, when was this system infected, was it the first one?
\item What else happened before and after?
\item How do we clean up?
\end{list2}

Some of these questions quickly become broad!

\slide{How to proceed}

\hlkimage{5cm}{dont-panic.png}

\hskip 6cm {\LARGE DON'T PANIC}

Especially hard to recommend next steps without some facts to support decisions.

\begin{list2}
\item Shutdown the internet connection?
\item Shutdown all servers vs KEEP RUNNING
\item Reinstall ALL servers, all laptops, all ...
\end{list2}

\slide{Incident Handling process}

Basic incident response process
\begin{list2}
\item Preparation for an attack, establish procedures and mechanisms for detecting and responding to attacks
\item Identification of an attack, notice the attack is ongoing
\item Containment (confinement) of the attack, limit effects of the attack as much as possible
\item Eradication of the attack, stop attacker, block further similar attacks
\item Recovery from the attack, restore system to a secure state
\item Follow-up to the attack, include lessons learned improve environment
\end{list2}

\begin{quote}{\bf
Building a Real-Life Security Data Science Team}\\

... a clear goal: Given an IP address (or IP/Port combination), {\bf search across all our perimeter devices in less than five minutes.}

Three core principles focused the team.
\begin{list2}
\item First, explore the open source versions of tools before engaging vendors. If you don’t
know how the sausage is being made, you really have no idea what’s being done, and
this is vital when working with real data.
\item Second, follow the mantra of “no single tool; no single database; and, no single approach
to solving a problem.” Do not put blinders on because you are either comfortable with
certain technologies or have an affinity for a certain tool.
\item Third, failure is expected, but you must learn from each journey down the wrong path.
Continuous adaptation and adjustment is the name of the game.

\slide{Get started quickly}

My recommendation today is to create a production-ready environment, but for learning the following are useful

Security Onion covers a lot of different areas, but is a bit heavy. Lots of great information and recommended tools\\
\link{https://securityonionsolutions.com/software/}

If you want to try out Suricata and focus on network traffic, try SELKS\\
\link{https://www.stamus-networks.com/selks}

Generic packet capture and Elastic beats\\
\link{https://www.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat}

Generic malware and malicious traffic detection -- Python based and easy to deploy\\
\link{https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail}

Brim is packaged as a desktop app, open a pcap and transform into Zeek logs in the ZNG format\\
\link{https://www.brimsecurity.com/}


\slide{Packetbeat}

\hlkimage{10cm}{demo-siem-setup-packetbeat.pdf}


\begin{list2}
\item By installing packetbeat and doing network mirroring from the network switch, we can gather a lot of information
\item Packetbeat supports Elastic Common Schema (ECS) \link{https://www.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat}
\item ICMP (v4 and v6)
DHCP (v4)
DNS
HTTP
AMQP 0.9.1
Cassandra
Mysql
PostgreSQL
Redis
Thrift-RPC
MongoDB
Memcache
NFS
TLS
SIP/SDP (beta)
\end{list2}


\slide{About equipment and exercises}

\begin{list2}
\item Bringing a laptop to my courses is not required, but welcome
\item Links etc. are in the slides and open source licensed, PDFs
\item Exercises booklets are available for many of my courses, see Github\\
but it is expected that participants will do any exercises on their own later or at the scheduled hacker days
\item The hacker days will be announced in various places

\item Events like BornHack are excellent places to arrange hacker days in the network warrior village, or other places
\end{list2}

\slide{Networking Hardware}

If you want to do exercises and work with networks \\
It will be an advantage to have a wireless USB network card and an USB Ethernet card.

The following are two models I have used:
\begin{list2}
\item TP-link TL-WN722N hardware version 2.0 cheap
\item Alfa AWUS036ACH 2.4GHz + 5GHz Dual-Band and high performing
\item Often you need to compile drivers yourself, and research a bit
\end{list2}

Getting an USB card allows you to use the regular one for the main OS, and insert the USB into the virtual machine



\slide{Network Security Monitoring -- Intrusion Detection}

\hlkimage{4cm}{network-security-monitoring.png}

\begin{list1}
\item Network Security Monitoring (NSM) - monitoring networks for intrusions, and reacting to those
\item networkbased intrusion detection systems (NIDS)
\item host based intrusion detection systems (HIDS)
\item Example full systems are Security Onion \link{https://securityonion.net/} or\\ SELKS \link{https://www.stamus-networks.com/open-source/}
\end{list1}

\slide{False Positives}

\begin{list2}
\item True Positive (TP). An alert that has correctly identified a specific activity. If a signature was designed to detect a certain type of malware, and an alert is generated when that malware is launched on a system, this would be a true positive, which is what we strive for with every deployed signature.Indicators of Compromise and Signatures
\item False Positive (FP). An alert has incorrectly identified a specific activity. If a signature was designed to detect a specific type of malware, and an alert is generated for an instance in which that malware was not present, this would be a false positive.
\item True Negative (TN). An alert has correctly not been generated when a specific activity has not occurred. If a signature was designed to detect a certain type of malware, and no alert is generated without that malware being launched, then this is a true negative, which is also desirable. This is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify in terms of NSM detection.
\item False Negative (FN). An alert has incorrectly not been generated when a specific activity has occurred.
\end{list2}

\slide{Detection Capabilities}


Security incidents happen, but what happens. One of the actions to reduce impact of incidents are done in preparing for incidents.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Preparation} for an attack, establish procedures and mechanisms for detecting and responding to attacks
\end{itemize}

Preparation will enable easy {\bf identification} of affected systems, better {\bf containment} which systems are likely to be infected, {\bf eradication} what happened -- how to do the {\bf eradication} and {\bf recovery}.



\slide{Indicators of Compromise and Signatures}

\begin{quote}
An IOC is any piece of information that can be used to objectively describe a
network intrusion, expressed in a platform-independent manner. This could include a simple indicator such as the IP address of a command and control (C2) server or a complex set of behaviors that indicate that a mail server is being used as a malicious SMTP relay.

When an IOC is taken and used in a platform-specific language or format, such as a Snort Rule or a Zeek-formatted file, it becomes part of a signature. A signature can contain one or more IOCs.

\end{list2}
\end{list1}

RFC-1958:
\begin{quote}
 A good analogy for the development of the Internet is that of
 constantly renewing the individual streets and buildings of a city,
 rather than razing the city and rebuilding it. The architectural
 principles therefore aim to provide a framework for creating
 cooperation and standards, as a small "spanning set" of rules that
 generates a large, varied and evolving space of technology.

\item To run in a “near zeekctl” mode:
\verb+zeek -r traffic.pcap local+
\item To add extra scripts:
\verb+zeek -r traffic.pcap myscript.zeek+
\end{list1}

\slide{zeek demo: Run}

\begin{alltt}\small
// install zeek first
kunoichi:~ root# zeekctl
Hint: Run the zeekctl "deploy" command to get started.

Welcome to ZeekControl 2.3.0

\slide{DNS is important}

Another tool that provides a basic SQL-frontend to PCAP-files\\
\url{https://www.dns-oarc.net/tools/packetq}\\
\url{https://github.com/DNS-OARC/PacketQ}

Going back in time and finding systems that visited a specific domain can explain when and where an infection started.

Deciding on which tool to use, Zeek or PacketQ depends on the situation.

\slide{NetFlow}

\begin{slidelist}
\item NetFlow is getting more important, more data share the same links
\item Accounting is important
\i\emph{Data-Driven Security: Analysis, Visualization and Dashboards} Jay Jacobs, Bob Rudistem Detecting DoS/DDoS and problems is essential
\item NetFlow sampling is vital information - 123Mbit, but what kind of traffic
\item Currently also investigating sFlow - hopefully more fine grained
\end{slidelist}



\slide{View data efficiently}

\hlkimage{10cm}{logstash-search.png}

\begin{list1}
\item View data by digging into it easily - must be fast
\item Logstash and Kibana are just examples, but use indexing to make it fast!
\item Other popular examples include Graylog and Grafana
\end{list1}

\slide{Big Data tools: Elasticsearch}

\hlkimage{10cm}{kibana-basics-with-vega.jpg}

\slide{Drill down process}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

We have seen Kibana multiple times, but how do you use it? I recommend the following iterative process
\begin{enumerate}
\item Get an overview
\item Research top talkers,
\item When identified and handled, remove with filter \verb+not host 10.1.2.3+
\item Look at the next ones
\end{enumerate}

Look into details, lookup hostnames -- hopefully your tool allows some help





\slide{Architecture}

\hlkimage{17cm}{elastic-stack-buffered.png}

\item Real production environments often add some buffering in between
\item Allows the ingestion to become more smooth, no lost messages

Metadata + Context



\slide{Summary, what to log}

\begin{list1}
\item CIP 7 Tools of the Trade, need to know NetFlow, DNS, and HTTP proxy logs in the real-world
\begin{list2}
\item Defense in Depth -- we will never catch everything
\item Log Management: The Security Event Data Warehouse
\item Intrusion Detection Isn’t Dead
\item DNS, the One True King -- Logging and analyzing DNS transactions, Blocking DNS requests or responses
\item HTTP Is the Platform: Web Proxies -- Web proxies allow you to solve additional security problems
\item Rolling Packet Capture -- In a perfect world, we would have full packet capture everywhere
\end{list2}
\end{list1}


\slide{Commercial Support}

You can and should use updated rulesets for Suricata.

I Recommend the Emerging Threats ET Pro ruleset, which is about USD 900 per year per sensor. So two sites with Suricata running in both, 2x USD 900

\slide{Summary}

We started from a basic Ubuntu/Debian server, and using Zeek and Suricata we now know more about our network.

We can collect logs about network traffic based on generic NetFlow, specific types DNS/TLS/protocols, and traffic matching advanced rulesets.

We know it is possible to create dashboards and visualizing the data.

What are the next steps?



\slide{Lets design a SIEM Infrastructure Proof of Concept}

\hlkimage{16cm}{demo-siem-setup.pdf}


\slide{Deploying security}

\begin{quote}{\bf
Security is a process, not a product.} Products provide some protection, but the only way to effectively do business in an insecure world is to put processes in place that recognize the inherent insecurity in the products. The trick is to reduce your risk of exposure regardless of the products or patches.
\end{quote}
Source: \link{https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2000/04/the_process_of_secur.html}

Today, we will consider the deployment plan being:
\begin{list2}
\item People -- make sure management is on board, Sources -- which data to gather,
\item Technology -- select SIEM, architecture, tools and products
\item Dashboards -- we have done parts of this, refer to SOC book also
\item Procedures -- left as a home exercise today
\end{list2}

\slide{Extended Sources}
When a basic logging infrastructure is setup, it can be expanded to increase coverage, by
adding more sources:

\begin{list2}
\item DNS query logging -- will enable multiple cases to be resolved, example malware identification and tracing, when was a malware domain queried, when was the first infection
\item Web proxy logging -- which web pages did which client access
\item Session data from Firewalls, Netflow -- traffic patterns can be investigated and both attacks and cases like exfiltration can likely be seen

\end{list2}

Hint: Take the sources available first, make a proof-of-concept, expand coverage

\slide{Baseline Skills}

\begin{list2}\small
\item Threat-Centric Security, NSM, and the NSM Cycle
\item TCP/IP Protocols
\item Common Application Layer Protocols
\item Packet Analysis
\item Windows Architecture
\item Linux Architecture
\item Basic Data Parsing (BASH, Grep, SED, AWK, etc)
\item IDS Usage (Snort, Suricata, etc.)
\item Indicators of Compromise and IDS Signature Tuning
\item Open Source Intelligence Gathering
\item Basic Analytic Diagnostic Methods
\item Basic Malware Analysis
\end{list2}

\begin{list1}
\item We need devops skillz in security
\item automate, security is also big data
\item integrate tools, transfer, sort, search, pattern matching, statistics, ...
\item tools, languages, databases, protocols, data formats
\item Use GitHub! So many libraries and programs that can help, maybe solve  90\% of your problem, and you can glue the rest together
\item Example introductions:
\begin{list2}
\item Seven languages/database/web frameworks in Seven Weeks
\item Elasticsearch the definitive guide

\slide{ANSM Summary}

\begin{quote}
ANSM chapter (7,8),9,10 - 140 pages\\
DETECTION MECHANISMS\\
Generally, detection is a function of software that parses through collected data in order to generate alert data. This software is referred to as a detection mechanism.

\begin{quote}
Chapter 7 Detection Mechanisms, Indicators of Compromise, and Signatures\\
Chapter 8 Reputation-Based Detection\\

Zeek in the default configuration activates 10.000s of script lines out-of-the-box.\\
Gives great output with little effort and complements Suricata/NIDS



\slide{ANSM Summary}

\hlkimage{6cm}{zeek-ids.png}

\begin{list1}
\item ANSM chapter 7: Detection Mechanisms and Indicators of Compromise, and Signatures

\begin{list2}
\item Indicators of Compromise (IOC) any piece of information that can be used to objectively describe a
network intrusion, expressed in a platform-independent manner
\item Background information, useful when we talk about Zeek (previously Bro) later
\item Intrusion Detection Systems try to detect ... but what if we know that some domains, servers, IPs etc are signs of bad activity - even compromise
\item IP reputation - some IPs are used for controlling malware command and control (C2) servers etc.
\item A signature can contain one or more IOCs
\end{list2}
\end{list1}


\slide{ANSM Summary, continued}

%\hlkimage{7cm}{NSM_Phases-300x238.png}

\begin{list1}
\item ANSM chapter 8: Reputation-Based Detection

\item The most basic form of intrusion detection is reputation-based detection
\item Similar concept to block lists for SMTP spam relays
\item I often recommend \link{https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail} as a source of lists
\item Other sources are lists like RIPE NCC delegated, which IP prefixes are handed out in different countries\\
