\slide{Plan for today}

\begin{list1}
\item Subjects
\begin{list2}
\item Data types: IP addresses, DNS, Netflow
\item Note: not all details about these types are explained today!
\end{list2}
\item Exercise theme: Low level, high value
\begin{list2}
\item Data types: IP addresses and reputation lists
\item Zeek as an example of a powerful multi-tool
\end{list2}
\end{list1}


\slide{Exercise setup}

We will use a combination of your virtual servers, my switch hardware and my virtual systems.

\vskip 1cm
{\Large \bf There will be sniffing done on traffic!\\
Don't abuse information gathered}

We try to mimic what you would do in your own networks during the exercises.

\begin{quote}
This chapter takes the “Hello World” concept and expands it to a walk-through of a self-contained, introductory security data analysis use case that you will be able to follow along with, execute, and take concepts from as you start to perform your own analyses. There are parallel examples in Python and R to provide a somewhat agnostic view of the similarities, strengths, and differences between both languages in a real-life data analysis context. If you’re not familiar with one or both of those languages, you should read Chapter 2 and at least skim some of the external resources referenced there.

\begin{quote}
This chapter focuses on exploring IP addresses by starting with further analyses on the AlienVault IP Reputation database first seen in Chapter 3.

IP addresses—along with domain names and routing concepts—are the building blocks of the Internet. They are defined in RFC 791, the “Internet Protocol / DARPA Internet Program / Protocol Specification” (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791), which has an elegant and succinct way of describing them:

\hskip 1cm A name \emph{indicates what we seek}. An address \emph{indicates where it is}. A route \emph{indicates how to get there}.

\slide{Indicators of Compromise and Signatures}

\begin{quote}
An IOC is any piece of information that can be used to objectively describe a
network intrusion, expressed in a platform-independent manner. This could include a simple indicator such as the IP address of a command and control (C2) ser
ver or a complex set of behaviors that indicate that a mail server is being used as a malicious SMTP relay.

When an IOC is taken and used in a platform-specific language or format, such as a Snort Rule or a Zeek-formatted file, it becomes part of a signature. A sign
ature can contain one or more IOCs.

\slide{Reading Summary, False Positives}

\begin{list2}
\item True Positive (TP). An alert that has correctly identified a specific activity. If a signature was designed to detect a certain type of malware, and an alert is generated when that malware is launched on a system, this would be a true positive, which is what we strive for with every deployed signature.Indicators of Compromise and Signatures
\item False Positive (FP). An alert has incorrectly identified a specific activity. If a signature was designed to detect a specific type of malware, and an alert is generated for an instance in which that malware was not present, this would be a false positive.
\item True Negative (TN). An alert has correctly not been generated when a specific activity has not occurred. If a signature was designed to detect a certain type of malware, and no alert is generated without that malware being launched, then this is a true negative, which is also desirable. This is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify in terms of NSM detection.
\item False Negative (FN). An alert has incorrectly not been generated when a specific activity has occurred.
