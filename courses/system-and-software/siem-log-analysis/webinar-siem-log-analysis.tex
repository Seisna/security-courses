\slide{Prerequisites}

\begin{list1}
\item This course includes exercises and getting the most of the course requires the participants to carry out these practical exercises

\item It is recommended to use virtual machines for the exercises
\item Security and most internet related security work has the following requirements:
\begin{list2}
\item Network experience
\item Server experience
\item TCP/IP principles - often in more detail than a common user
\item Programming is an advantage, for automating things
\item Some Linux and Unix knowledge is in my opinion a {\bf necessary skill} for infosec work\\
-- too many new tools to ignore, and lots found at sites like Github and Open Source written for Linux
\end{list2}

\slide{SIEM}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Security information and event management (SIEM)} is a subsection within the field of computer security, where software products and services combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). They provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware.

  Vendors sell SIEM as software, as appliances, or as managed services; these products are also used to log security data and generate reports for compliance purposes.[1]

  The term and the initialism SIEM was coined by Mark Nicolett and Amrit Williams of Gartner in 2005.[2]
\end{quote}
Source: \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management}

\begin{list2}
  \item Note: there are alerting examples towards the bottom of the page, with sources
  \item Closely related to log management, incident response
\end{list2}


\slide{SOC}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
An information security operations center (ISOC or SOC) is a facility where enterprise information systems (web sites, applications, databases, data centers and servers, networks, desktops and other endpoints) are monitored, assessed, and defended.

...

A security operations center (SOC) can also be called a security defense center (SDC), security analytics center (SAC), network security operations center (NSOC),[3] security intelligence center, cyber security center, threat defense center, security intelligence and operations center (SIOC). In the Canadian Federal Government the term, infrastructure protection center (IPC), is used to describe a SOC.
\end{quote}
Source: \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security_operations_center}

\begin{list2}
  \item We have a whole book about SOCs, but I skipped the introductory chapters!
  \item If you need to build a SOC, that is great source of information
\end{list2}

\slide{Crafting the InfoSec Playbook}


This book will help you to answer common questions:
\begin{list2}
\item How do I find bad actors on my network?
\item How do I find persistent attackers?
\item How can I deal with the pervasive malware threat?
\item How do I detect system compromises?
\item How do I find an owner or responsible parties for systems under my protection?
\item How can I practically use and develop threat intelligence?
\item How can I possibly manage all my log data from all my systems?
\item How will I benefit from increased logging—and not drown in all the noise?
\item How can I use metadata for detection?

\item Example systems: Unix syslog, IBM main frame RACF and Windows Event Logs service
\item \emph{swatchdog} is an old skool, but simple tool that works
\item Logs should be protected and considered confidential information

\slide{Why Elasticsearch}

\hlkimage{8cm}{illustrated-screenshot-hero-siem-500x730.png}
Screenshot from \url{https://www.elastic.co/siem}

Recommend building a proof-of-concept infrastructure using the Elastic stack and gather experience with logging. This can be done without a license fee and the organization can then see what works and doesn't. Then using the experiences as input an informed decision can be made, to continue with this as a home grown logging and auditing solution, or buy a premade one.


\slide{Technologies used in this course}

The following tools and environments are examples that may be introduced in this course:

\begin{list2}
\item Programming languages and frameworks Java, Python, regular expressions
\item Development environments -- choose your own IDE / Editor -- I use {\bf Atom}
\item Networking and network protocols: TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, Netflow
\item Formats XML, JSON, CSV, raw text, web scraping
\item Web technologies and services: REST, API, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
\item Tools like cURL, Zeek, Git and Github
\item Message queueing systems: MQ and Redis could be added
\item Aggregated example platforms: Elastic stack, logstash, elasticsearch, kibana, grafana, Filebeat
\item Cloud and virtualisation Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, AWS, microservices -- can be added
\end{list2}

\slide{Indicators of Compromise and Signatures}

\begin{quote}
An IOC is any piece of information that can be used to objectively describe a
network intrusion, expressed in a platform-independent manner. This could include a simple indicator such as the IP address of a command and control (C2) ser
ver or a complex set of behaviors that indicate that a mail server is being used as a malicious SMTP relay.

When an IOC is taken and used in a platform-specific language or format, such as a Snort Rule or a Zeek-formatted file, it becomes part of a signature. A sign
ature can contain one or more IOCs.
