Building a Real-Life Security Data Science Team}\\

... a clear goal: Given an IP address (or IP/Port combination), {\bf search across all our perimeter devices in less than five minutes.}

Three core principles focused the team.
\begin{list2}
\item First, explore the open source versions of tools before engaging vendors. If you don’t
know how the sausage is being made, you really have no idea what’s being done, and
this is vital when working with real data.
\item Second, follow the mantra of “no single tool; no single database; and, no single approach
to solving a problem.” Do not put blinders on because you are either comfortable with
certain technologies or have an affinity for a certain tool.
\item Third, failure is expected, but you must learn from each journey down the wrong path.
Continuous adaptation and adjustment is the name of the game.

When you begin implementing intelligence-driven incident response, it is important to have a solid understanding of both intelligence and incident-response processes. Part 1 provides an introduction to cyber-threat intelligence, the intelligence process, the incident-response process, and how they all work together.

\begin{quote}
There was a time when many people considered indicators of compromise, or IOCs, to be synonymous with threat intelligence. IOCs, which we will reference a lot and cover in depth later in the book, are things to look for on a system or in network logs that may indicate that a compromise has taken place. This includes IP addresses and domains associated with command-and-control servers or malware downloads, hashes of malicious files, and other network- or host-based artifacts that may indicate an intrusion. As we will discuss throughout this book, however, there is far more to threat intelligence than IOCs, although IOCs still remain one of the most common types of technical intelligence around intrusions.

\slide{Side note: redundancy}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Redundancy can often be achieved in multiple ways
\item Two servers - physical servers
\item Two disks - RAID1 mirrors
\item OR using virtualisation
\item Redundancy is not an alternative to backup!
\item Make sure you plan for upgrades too! Upgrading one server while the other handle messages
\end{list2}



\slide{Drill down process}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

We have seen Kibana multiple times, but how do you use it? I recommend the following iterative process
\begin{enumerate}
\item Get an overview
\item Research top talkers,
\item When identified and handled, remove with filter \verb+not host 10.1.2.3+
\item Look at the next ones
\end{enumerate}

Look into details, lookup hostnames -- hopefully your tool allows some help




\slide{How to get started}

\begin{list1}
\item How to get started searching for security events?
\item Collect basic data from your devices and networks
\begin{list2}
\item Netflow data from routers
\item Session data from firewalls
\item Logging from applications: email, web, proxy systems
\end{list2}
\item {\bf Centralize!}
\item Process data
\begin{list2}
\item Top 10: interesting due to high frequency, occurs often, brute-force attacks
\item {\it ignore}
\item Bottom 10: least-frequent messages are interesting
\end{list2}
\end{list1}





\slide{Logstash pipeline }

\begin{quote}
  Logstash is an open source, server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favorite “stash.” (Ours is Elasticsearch, naturally.)\\
  \link{https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash}

\slide{Deploying security}

\begin{quote}{\bf
Security is a process, not a product.} Products provide some protection, but the only way to effectively do business in an insecure world is to put processes in place that recognize the inherent insecurity in the products. The trick is to reduce your risk of exposure regardless of the products or patches.
\end{quote}
Source: \link{https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2000/04/the_process_of_secur.html}

Today, we will consider the deployment plan being:
\begin{list2}
\item People -- make sure management is on board, Sources -- which data to gather,
\item Technology -- select SIEM, architecture, tools and products
\item Dashboards -- we have done parts of this, refer to SOC book also
\item Procedures -- left as a home exercise today
\end{list2}



\slide{People: Data Analysis Skills}

\begin{quote}
Although we could spend an entire book creating an exhaustive list of skills needed to be a good security data scientist, this chapter covers the following skills/domains that a data scientist will benefit from
knowing within information security:
\begin{list2}
\item Domain expertise—Setting and maintaining a purpose to the analysis
\item Data management—Being able to prepare, store, and maintain data
\item Programming—The glue that connects data to analysis
\item Statistics—To learn from the data
\item Visualization—Communicating the results effectively
\end{list2}
It might be easy to label any one of these skills as the most important, but in reality, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Each of these contributes a significant and important piece to the workings of
security data science.

\slide{People: Get management buy-in}

\hlkimage{6cm}{margarida-csilva-121801-unsplash.jpg}

You will probably need help from:

\begin{list2}
\item Buy-in from management, for requesting resources
\item Network and security departments -- getting data, opening ports
\item Application developers, web site programmers
\end{list2}

\slide{Sources: Network overview without SIEM}

\hlkimage{15cm}{sample-ip-network.pdf}

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Internet, routers, firewalls, switches, clients and servers (Wi-Fi not shown)
\end{list2}


\slide{Sources: Strategy for implementing identification and detection}

We recommend that the following strategy is used for implementing identification and detection -- logging:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\faSquareO] Enable system logging from servers
\item[\faSquareO] Enable system logging from network devices
\item[\faSquareO] Enable logging from client devices
\item[\faSquareO] Centralize logging
\item[\faSquareO] Add search facilities and dashboards
\item[\faSquareO] Perform system audits manually or automatically
\item[\faSquareO] Setup alerting and notification with procedures
\end{enumerate}

\slide{Extended Sources}
When a basic logging infrastructure is setup, it can be expanded to increase coverage, by
adding more sources:

\begin{list2}
\item DNS query logging -- will enable multiple cases to be resolved, example malware identification and tracing, when was a malware domain queried, when was the first infection
\item Web proxy logging -- which web pages did which client access
\item Session data from Firewalls, Netflow -- traffic patterns can be investigated and both attacks and cases like exfiltration can likely be seen

\end{list2}

Hint: Take the sources available first, make a proof-of-concept, expand coverage





\slide{Architecture: Tools}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

We will use the tools presented during the course:
\begin{list2}
\item Elastic stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat, Packetbeat
\item Zeek and Suricata can easily be added at a later stage
\item Likewise DNS and web proxy logging could be added
\end{list2}

\vskip 1cm

The setup discussed here would be a good proof of conccept, and be valuable almost immediately

\slide{Elasticsearch}

\hlkimage{6cm}{demo-siem-setup-elasticsearch.pdf}


\begin{list2}
\item We plan to build a basic cluster with Elasticsearch, latest stable
\item Multiple ES nodes for easier upgrade, redundancy and performance
\item Each have 200Gb disk and 16Gb memory allocated
\end{list2}




\slide{Logstash -- syslog and SNMP trap receiver}

\hlkimage{6cm}{demo-siem-setup-logstash.pdf}

\begin{list2}
\item We have network devices which can only send syslog and SNMP trap -- \emph{push events from the network}
\item So enable inputs: snmptrap, tcp, udp and use UFW to redirect ports
\item We have made two servers, which use VRRP to have a common address
\end{list2}

\slide{Packetbeat}

\hlkimage{10cm}{demo-siem-setup-packetbeat.pdf}


\begin{list2}
\item By installing packetbeat and doing network mirroring from the network switch, we can gather a lot of information
\item Packetbeat supports Elastic Common Schema (ECS) \link{https://www.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat}
\item ICMP (v4 and v6)
DHCP (v4)
DNS
HTTP
AMQP 0.9.1
Cassandra
Mysql
PostgreSQL
Redis
Thrift-RPC
MongoDB
Memcache
NFS
TLS
SIP/SDP (beta)
\end{list2}


\slide{Application servers}

\hlkimage{3cm}{demo-siem-setup-servers.pdf}

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item We told the server and application people to use Filebeat and Syslog
\item The Linux people decided to use syslog
\item Windows servers use Filebeat \link{}https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat
\item All of them send to the Logstash instances
\end{list2}

\slide{Baseline}

\hlkimage{10cm}{nfsen-ddos-profile-1.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Picture from NFsen running a specific profile to catch attacks
\item When you have a running system, it will start to gather a baseline
\item Comparing data from various times become possible, and usefull
\item The best baseline is from running the actual systems and services for an extended \emph{learning} period
\end{list2}

\slide{Alerting}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}\small
We’re excited to announce a new alerting framework that delivers a first-class alerting experience natively within the SIEM, Uptime, APM, and Metrics applications as part of the Kibana 7.7 release.

Alerting is a fundamental use case across the Elastic Stack, which is why we’re making it part of the core experience within Kibana. Whether you are monitoring application transactions or tracking brute force login attempts, our goal is to provide a tailored experience that allows you to build powerful alerts in the normal flow of your task. The new alerting framework is built from the ground up and designed to offer more than just convenient interfaces. We understand the need to go beyond just notifying people which is why we’ve also incorporated the ability to trigger predefined actions that can do anything from sending an email to using brand new third-party integrations with platforms like Slack and PagerDuty.

The new alerting framework is being introduced as a beta in the 7.7 release of Kibana and is available immediately on the Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, or for download.

\slide{Common task: Elasticsearch Upgrades!}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Should we try upgrading to ES 8?
\end{quote}

How would we proceed
\begin{list2}
\item Make a backup, clone the VM
\item Update repositories, ansible or manually (we only have on cluster node)
\item Shut down ES, easy since only one node
\item Upgrade software and start again -- this will update the data on that node!
\end{list2}

Extra steps are needed when upgrading larger clusters

\slide{ES reporting}
