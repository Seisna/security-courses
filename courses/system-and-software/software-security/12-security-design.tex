\slide{Principle of Least Privilege}

\begin{list1}
\item {\bf Definition 14-1} The \emph{principle of least privilege} states that a subject should be given only those privileges that it needs in order to complete the task.
\item Also drop privileges when not needed anymore, relinquish rights immediately
\item Example, need to read a document - but not write.
\item Database systems can often provide very fine grained access to data
\end{list1}


\slide{Principle of Fail-Safe defaults}

\begin{list1}
\item {\bf Definition 14-3} The \emph{principle of fail-safe defaults} states that, unless a subject is given explicit access to an object, it should be denied access to that object.
\item Default access \emph{none}
\item In firewalls default-deny - that which is not allowed is prohibited
\item Newer devices today can come with no administrative users, while older devices often came with default admin/admin users
\item Real world example, OpenSSH config files that come with \verb+PermitRootLogin no+
\end{list1}


\slide{Principle of Economy of Mechanism}

\begin{list1}
\item {\bf Definition 14-4} The \emph{principle of economy of mechanism} states that security mechanisms should be as simple as possible.
\item Simple $->$ fewer complications $->$ fewer security errors
\item Use WPA passphrase instead of MAC address based authentication
\item
\end{list1}


\slide{Principle of Complete Mediation}

\begin{list1}
\item {\bf Definition 14-5} The \emph{principle of complete mediation} requires that all accesses to objects be checked to ensure that they are allowed.
\item Always perform check
\item Time of check, time of use
\item Example Unix file descriptors - access check first, then can be reused in the future
\item Caching can be bad.
\end{list1}


\slide{Principle of Open Design}

\hlkimage{8cm}{debath-stego.png}

Source: picture from \link{https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Gallery/Stego/index.html}
\begin{list1}
\item {\bf Definition 14-6} The \emph{principle of open design} states that the security of a mechanism should not depend on the secrecy of its design or implementation.
\item Content Scrambling System (CSS) used on DVD movies
\item Mobile data encryption  A5/1 key
\end{list1}

\slide{Files, objects, users, groups and roles}

\begin{quote}
Establish secure defaults
There are many ways to deliver an “out of the box” experience for users. However, by default, the experience should be secure, and it should be up to the user to reduce their security – if they are allowed.

For example, by default, password aging and complexity should be enabled. Users might be allowed to turn these two features off to simplify their use of the application and increase their risk.

\item Applications dont run in vacuum, they run in existing environments
\item Make sure to integrate with existing solutions, dont expect a clean slate
\item Make it easy to use by following convention

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{java}
isAdmin = true;
try {
  codeWhichMayFail();
  isAdmin = isUserInRole( “Administrator” );
}
catch (Exception ex) {
  log.write(ex.toString());
}
\end{minted}
"If either codeWhichMayFail() or isUserInRole fails or throws an exception, the user is an admin by default. This is obviously a security risk."\\
Source: OWASP Security by Design Principles\\
\url{https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Security_by_Design_Principles}

\begin{list2}
\item DO use exception handling!
\item Just make sure code does not end up giving more privileges when failing!
\end{list2}

\slide{Separation of Duties and Function}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Separation of duties} (SoD; also known as Segregation of Duties) is the concept of having more than one person required to complete a task. In business the separation by sharing of more than one individual in one single task is an internal control intended to prevent fraud and error.
\end{quote}

Quote from \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_duties}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Separation of function}. Developers do not develop new programs on production systems because of the potential threat to production data.

Danish: Funktionsadskillelse


\slide{Role-based Access Control (RBAC)}

\begin{quote}
In computer systems security, {\bf role-based access control (RBAC)}[1][2] or role-based security[3] is an approach to restricting system access to unauthorized users. It is used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees,[4] and can implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around {\bf roles and privileges}. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments. A study by NIST has demonstrated that RBAC addresses many needs of commercial and government organizations[citation needed]. RBAC can be used to facilitate administration of security in large organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions. Although RBAC is different from MAC and DAC access control frameworks, it can enforce these policies without any complication.

\slide{Privacy by Design}

\begin{quote}
Objectives of the report\\
This report shall promote the discussion on how privacy by design can be implemented with the help
of engineering methods. It provides a basis for better understanding of the current state of the art
concerning privacy by design with a focus on the technological side.

“Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person—for a
detailed discussion see [19]. This is related to the term personally identifiable information (PII), as e.g.
used in the privacy framework standardised by ISO/IEC [125].

\begin{list2}
\item Next, if the application is secure, what about handling and protecting personal data
\end{list2}

\slide{ENISA: List of Recommendations}

\begin{list2}
\item {\small Policy makers need to support the development of new incentive mechanisms for privacy-friendly services and need to promote them.}
\item {\small The research community needs to further investigate in privacy engineering, especially with a
multidisciplinary approach. This process should be supported by research funding agencies.
The results of research need to be promoted by policy makers and media.}
\item {\small Providers of software development tools and the research community need to offer tools that
enable the intuitive implementation of privacy properties.}
\item {\small Especially in publicly co-founded infrastructure projects, privacy-supporting components,
such as key servers and anonymising relays, should be included.}
\item {\small Data protection authorities should play an important role providing independent guidance
and assessing modules and tools for privacy engineering.}
\item {\small Legislators need to promote privacy and data protection in their norms.}
\item {\small Standardisation bodies need to include privacy considerations in the standardisation process.}
\item {\small Standards for interoperability of privacy features should be provided by standardization bodies.}
\end{list2}

\slide{Privacy Protection Goals}

\begin{quote}\footnotesize
In ICT
security the triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability has been widely accepted. ...
As complement to these security protection goals, three privacy-specific protection goals were pro-
posed in 2009 [172], namely unlinkability, transparency, and intervenability.
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item {\small \emph{Unlinkability}. Unlinkability ensures that privacy-relevant data cannot be linked across domains that are constituted by a common purpose and context, and that means that processes have to be oper-
ated in such a way that the privacy-relevant data are unlinkable to any other set of privacy-
relevant data outside of the domain.}
\item {\small \emph{Transparency.} Transparency ensures that all privacy-relevant data processing including the
legal, technical and organisational setting can be understood and reconstructed at any time.
The information has to be available before, during and after the processing takes place. Thus,
transparency has to cover not only the actual processing, but also the planned processing (ex-
ante transparency) and the time after the processing has taken place to know what exactly
happened (ex-post transparency).}
\item {\small \emph{Intervenability.} Intervenability ensures intervention is possible concerning all ongoing or
planned privacy-relevant data processing, in particular by those persons whose data are pro-
cessed. The objective of intervenability is the application of corrective measures and counter-
balances where necessary.}
\end{list2}

\slide{Data oriented strategies}

\begin{list2}
\item Strategy \#1: MINIMISE\\
The most basic privacy design strategy is MINIMISE, which states that the amount of personal data
that is processed 27 should be restricted to the minimal amount possible.
\item Strategy \#2: HIDE
The second design strategy, HIDE, states that any personal data, and their interrelationships, should
be hidden from plain view.
\item Strategy \#3: SEPARATE
The third design strategy, SEPARATE, states that personal data should be processed in a distributed
fashion, in separate compartments whenever possible.
\item Strategy \#4: AGGREGATE
The fourth design pattern, AGGREGATE, states that Personal data should be processed at the highest
level of aggregation and with the least possible detail in which it is (still) useful.
\end{list2}



\slide{Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)}

\begin{quote}\small
Privacy-by-design er en tilgang, der sikrer, at virksomheden indarbejder databeskyttelse som en integreret del af virksomhedens forretningsprocesser, værdikæde og produktlivscyklus. Lige fra produktionsfasen til at produktet havner hos slutbrugeren.
...
Udarbejd en konsekvensanalyse (PIA)\\
En god tilgang til at sikre privacy-by-design/default er, at udarbejde en konsekvensanalyse også kaldet en PIA (Privacy Impact Assessment), der tydeliggør konsekvenserne af virksomhedens databehandling.
\end{quote}

En PIA skal som minimum indeholde følgende:

\begin{list2}
\item En beskrivelse af de påtænkte databehandlinger og deres formål.
\item En vurdering af behandlingens nødvendighed og proportionalitet.
\item En vurdering af risikoen for de personer, hvis persondata bliver behandlet.
\item Foranstaltninger til at imødegå risici og demonstrere overholdelse af persondataforordningen.

\slide{Center for Internet Security CIS Controls}

\begin{quote}
  The CIS ControlsTM are a prioritized set of actions that collectively form a defense-in-depth set
of best practices that mitigate the most common attacks against systems and networks. The
CIS Controls are developed by a community of IT experts who apply their first-hand experience
as cyber defenders to create these globally accepted security best practices. The experts who
develop the CIS Controls come from a wide range of sectors including retail, manufacturing,
healthcare, education, government, defense, and others.

\slide{Center for Internet Security CIS Controls 7.1}

\begin{list2}
\item
The five critical tenets of an effective cyber defense system as reflected
in the CIS Controls are:
\item {\bf Offense informs defense:} Use knowledge of actual attacks that have
compromised systems to provide the foundation to continually learn
from these events to build effective, practical defenses. Include only
those controls that can be shown to stop known real-world attacks.
\item {\bf Prioritization:} Invest first in Controls that will provide the greatest risk
reduction and protection against the most dangerous threat actors
and that can be feasibly implemented in your computing environment.
The CIS Implementation Groups discussed below are a great place for
organizations to start identifying relevant Sub-Controls.
\item {\bf Measurements and Metrics:} Establish common metrics to provide a
shared language for executives, IT specialists, auditors, and security
officials to measure the effectiveness of security measures within
an organization so that required adjustments can be identified and
implemented quickly.
\item {\bf Continuous diagnostics and mitigation:} Carry out continuous
measurement to test and validate the effectiveness of current security
measures and to help drive the priority of next steps.
\item {\bf Automation:} Automate defenses so that organizations can achieve
reliable, scalable, and continuous measurements of their adherence to
the Controls and related metrics. \hskip 2cm Source:
