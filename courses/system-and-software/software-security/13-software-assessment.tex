\slide{Goals: Software Assessment Introduction}

\hlkimage{10cm}{nesa-by-makers-IgUR1iX0mqM-unsplash.jpg}

\begin{list1}

\slide{Software Vulnerability Fundamentals}

Vulnerability, bugs, exploiting with an exploit
\begin{list2}
\item AoSSA Chapter 1 refer to a book - which now is available in updated version\\
\emph{Computer Security: Art and Science}, 2nd edition 2019! Matt Bishop ISBN: 9780321712332\\
We use this book in the course \emph{Computer Systems Security}
\item Security policies are introduced with a few examples: formal specifications, formal written policy or informal ambiguous collection
\item Real organisations have policies from high level mission-type statements down to detailed instructions for operationel procedures
\item Often organized in a information security management system (ISMS)
\end{list2}

\slide{Security policy}

\begin{quote}
A security policy defines \emph{secure} for a system or a set of systems.\\
Matt Bishop, Computer Security 2019
\end{quote}

\begin{list1}
\item Secure states
\item Transitions between states, what is allowed
\item Breach of security - system enters an unauthorized state
\item Is it possible to return from insecure to a secure state?
\item Book also defines Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability more precisely
\item \emph{Origin integrity} authentication
\item Military security policy (coinfidentiality) vs commercial security policy (integrity)
\end{list1}

\slide{Assumptions}

\begin{quote}
Any security policy, mechanism, or procedure is based on assumptions that, if incorrect, destroy the superstructure on which it is built.\\
Matt Bishop, Computer Security 2019
\end{quote}

\begin{list1}
\item Example, vendor patches
\item Important points:
\begin{list2}
\item Is patch correct? Example Spectre and heartbleed
\item Vendor test environments equal to intended environments
\item Installed correctly - including operator skills
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

\slide{Types of Access Control}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Definition 4-13.} If an individual user can set an access control mechanism to allow or deny access to an object, that mechanism is a \emph{discretionary access control (DAC)}, also called an \emph{identity-based access control (IBAC)}

{\bf Definition 4-14.}  When a system mechanism controls access to an object and an individual user cannot alter that access, the control is a \emph{mandatory access control (MAC)}, occasionally cale a \emph{rule-based access control}
\end{quote}

Quote from Matt Bishop, Computer Security 2019

\slide{Examples from real life systems}

Example systems implementing DAC/MAC:
\begin{list2}
\item Unix file permissions - DAC
\item SELinux - Mandatory Access Control architecture to the Linux Kernel
\item Sun's Trusted Solaris uses a mandatory and system-enforced access control mechanism
\end{list2}

\slide{Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability}

\hlkimage{8cm}{cia-triad-uk.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item We want to protect something
\item Confidentiality - data kept a secret
\item Integrity - data is not subjected to unauthorized changes
\item Availability - data and systems are available when needed
\end{list1}

\slide{Security is a process}

\begin{list1}
\item Remember:
\begin{list2}
\item what is information and security?
\item Data kept electronically
\item Data kept in physical form
\item Dont forget the human element of security
\end{list2}
\item Incident Response and Computer Forensics reaction to incidents
\item Good security is the result of planning and long-term work
\end{list1}

\slide{Security in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)}

\hlkimage{6cm}{OWASP-SDLC.jpg}

\begin{quote}\small{\bf
When to Test?}\\
Most people today donâ€™t test software until it has already been created and is in the deployment phase of its life cycle (i.e., code has been created and instantiated into a working web application). This is generally a very ineffective and cost-prohibitive practice. One of the best methods to prevent security bugs from appearing in production applications is to improve the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by including security in each of its phases.

\slide{Work together}

\hlkimage{9cm}{Shaking-hands_web.jpg}

\begin{list1}
\item Team up!
\item We need to share security information freely
\item We often face the same threats, so we can work on solving these together
\end{list1}


\slide{How to do Review and audit of software}

\begin{quote}
Auditing an application is the process of analyzing application code (in source or binary form) to uncover vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit
\end{quote}
Source: AoSSA chapter 1

\begin{list2}
\item Identify and close security holes
\item Auditing vs black box testing
\item Black box testing is quick to get started, like fuzzing
\item Example in book, a certain input \verb+mode+ triggers a special code path with \verb+sprintf+
\item Incoporate Code Auditing into the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
\end{list2}

\slide{Software Development Lifecycle}

\begin{quote}
  A full lifecycle approach is the only way to achieve secure software.\\
  --Chris Wysopal
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Often security testing is an afterthought
\item Vulnerabilities emerge during design and implementation
\item Before, during and after approach is needed
\end{list2}

\slide{Secure Software Development Lifecycle}

\begin{list2}
\item SSDL represents a structured approach toward implementing and performing secure software development
\item Security issues evaluated and addressed early
\item During business analysis
\item through requirements phase
\item during design and implementation
\end{list2}

\slide{Design vs Implementation}

Software vulnerabilities can be divided into two major categories:
\begin{list2}
\item Design vulnerabilities
\item Implementation vulnerabilities
\end{list2}

Even with a well-thought-out security design a program can contain implementation flaws.

\slide{Common Secure Design Issues}

\begin{list2}
\item Design must specify the security model's structure\\
Not having this written down is a common problem
\item Common problem AAA Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (book uses audited)
\item Weak or Missing Session Management
\item Weak or Missing Authentication
\item Weak or Missing Authorization
\end{list2}


\slide{Operationel Vulnerabilities}

\begin{list2}
\item Security Problems that arise through the operational procedures
\item General use of a piece of software in a specific environment
\item How the software interacts with its environment
\item Recommendation, automate deployment!
\item Taking days to install, configure and deploy software is a {\bf red flag}
\end{list2}


\slide{Design Review}

\begin{list2}
\item Design review is a useful tool for identifying vulnerabilities in application architecture and prioritizing components for implementation review
\item Optimize the process, which parts are most security critical
\item Algorithms, problem domain logic, key algorithms
\item Trust relationships and trust boundaries
\end{list2}


\slide{Enforcing Security Policy}

\begin{list2}
\item AoSSA repeats the same problems:
\item Authentication
\item Untrustworthy credentials
\item Insufficient Validation
\item Authorization
\item Accountability
\end{list2}


\slide{Confidentiality}

\begin{list2}
\item Encryption algorithms
\item Book describes the common terms used in this area
\item Use the \emph{IT Security Guidelines for Transport Layer Security (TLS)} from the dutch National Cyber Security Centre\\
{\footnotesize\url{https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2021/january/19/it-security-guidelines-for-transport-layer-security-2.1}}

\item and Cisco \emph{Next Generation Cryptography}\\
{\footnotesize\url{https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/next_generation_cryptography}}
\end{list2}




\slide{Application Architecture Modelling}

\begin{list2}
\item Unified Markup Language (UML)
\item Class diagrams
\item Component diagrams
\item Use cases
\item Data flow diagram (DFD)
\item Processes
\item Data stores
\item External entities
\item Data flow
\item Trust boundary
\item Threat identification is the process of determining an appplcations security exposure based on your knowledge of the system
\end{list2}


\slide{Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle}

There are five major threat modeling steps:
\begin{list2}
\item Defining security requirements.
\item Creating an application diagram.
\item Identifying threats.
\item Mitigating threats.
\item Validating that threats have been mitigated.
Threat modeling should be part of your routine development lifecycle, enabling you to progressively refine your threat model and further reduce risk.
\end{list2}

\slide{Risk-Based Security Testing}

\begin{quote}
Focus testing on areas where difficulty of attack is least and the impact is highest.\\
  --Chris Wysopal
\end{quote}

\begin{list1}
\item Time and resources are constrained
\item Software development must be prioritized
\item Threat modelling / risk modelling exist to help this
\begin{list2}
\item Identify threat paths
\item Identify threats
\item Identify vulnerabilities
\item Rank/prioritize the vulnerabilities
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

Sounds easy enough, harder to do


\slide{Attack trees}

\hlkimage{7cm}{paper-attacktrees-fig1.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Attacks can be said to be based on a chain of dependencies, or graphs
\item To achieve goal, need to achieve sub goal x, y, and z -- Break the chain and the attack fails!
\item Simple example, installing updates remove a dependency for a vulnerability
\item Attack trees, picture from Bruce Schneier Attack Trees article December 1999:\\ {\footnotesize\link{https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1999/12/attack_trees.html}}
\end{list2}



\slide{Exposure, Attack surfaces, and reducing them}

\begin{list2}
\item Incident prevention
\item Real-time intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS)
\item {\bf Definition 27-7} An \emph{attack surface} is the set of entry points and data that attackers can use to compromise a system.
\item Reducing the chance of success also helps, randomization
\item Use stack and heap protection
\item Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a host-level moving target defense.
\item OpenBSD even randomizes the kernel on install -- kernel address randomized link (KARL)
\item Limit number of listening services, change insecure defaults, implement access control and firewalls
\item Remove anything but the necessary request methods on web servers \verb+GET+, \verb+HEAD+ and \verb+POST+
\item Restrict access to administrative interfaces
\item Implement network segmentation
\end{list2}



\slide{MITRE ATT\&CK framework}
