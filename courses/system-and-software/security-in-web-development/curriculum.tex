This material is prepared for use in \emph{\subject} and was prepared by
Henrik Kramselund, \url{xhek@kea.dk}.

Updated on 2022-11-01

It contains the curriculum for the course Fall 2022, which is:

\begin{list1}
\item[\faSquareO] The whole book \emph{Web Application Security}, Andrew Hoffman! All chapters are listed in the lecture plan
\item[\faSquareO] The exam project is part of curriculum \verb+security-in-web-development-exam-project.pdf+
\item[\faSquareO] Slides, while not a replacement for the book are part of the content. The versions in Fronter may have a few typos, and the main source are in:\\
\link{https://github.com/kramse/security-courses/tree/master/courses/system-and-software/security-in-web-development}
\item[\faSquareO] The articles from Fronter: \verb+How-GitHub-secures-open-source-software.pdf+ and \verb+secure-coding-best-practices-handbook-veracode-guide.pdf+
\item[\faSquareO] I will mark the exercises in the exercise booklet which I think are important. I cannot force you to do them, but I expect you know about the subjects used in those exercises.
\end{list1}

I will hand this document over to the censor for the course.

Best regards

Henrik Kramselund, he/him
