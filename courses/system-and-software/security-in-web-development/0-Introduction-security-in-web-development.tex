\slide{Exercises}

Exercise theme: Virtual Machines allows us play with tech

Hardware

Since we are going to be doing exercises, each team will need virtual machines.

The following are recommended systems:
\begin{list2}
\item One VM based on Debian, running software servers and web applications
\item One VM based on Kali Linux, running hacking tools -- primary tool is Burp Suite and browser
\item Setup instructions and help \url{https://github.com/kramse/kramse-labs}
\end{list2}

Linux is a toolbox we will use and participants will use virtual machines

\vskip 1cm
PS We will from time to time have exercises, groups dont need to be the same each time.

\slide{Goals and plans}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
  “A goal without a plan is just a wish.”\\
  ― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
\end{quote}

I want this course to
\begin{list2}
\item Include everything listed in contents above
\item Be practical -- you can do something useful
\item Kickstart your journey into Web Security\\
Getting a practical book with pointers about the subject
\item Present a lot of useful sources and tools
\item Prepare you for production use of the knowledge
\end{list2}

We have a lot of flexibility.


\slide{Prerequisites}

\begin{list1}
\item This course includes exercises and getting the most of the course requires the participants to carry out these practical exercises
\item We will use Linux for some exercises but previous Linux and Unix knowledge is not needed
\item It is recommended to use virtual machines for the exercises
\item Security and most internet related security work has the following requirements:
\begin{list2}
\item Network experience
\item Server experience
\item TCP/IP principles - often in more detail than a common user
\item Programming is an advantage, for automating things
\item Some Linux and Unix knowledge is in my opinion a {\bf necessary skill} for infosec work\\
-- too many new tools to ignore, and lots found at sites like Github and Open Source written for Linux
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

\slide{Mixed exercises}
Then we will do a mixed bag of exercises to introduce technologies, find your current knowledge level with regards to:

\begin{list2}
\item Linux
\item Linux command line
\item Git, Python and Ansible
\item Elasticsearch -- how to run a \emph{service}
\item Running Java on Linux -- environment variables?!
\item Ansible provisioning -- installing and configuring software for production
\end{list2}

{\bf Note: today we will consider all these optional, we wont be able to do them all}

Later we will return to them!

\slide{Command prompts in Unix}

\begin{list1}
\item Shells :
  \begin{list2}
    \item sh - Bourne Shell
\item bash - Bourne Again Shell, often the default in Linux
\item ksh - Korn shell, original by David Korn, but often the public domain version used
\item csh - C shell, syntax similar to C language
\item Multiple others available, zsh is very popular
  \end{list2}
\item Windows have \verb+command.com+, \verb+cmd.exe+ but PowerShell is more similar to the Unix shells
\item Used for scripting, automation and programs
\end{list1}



\slide{Command prompts}

\begin{alltt}
[hlk@debian hlk]$ id
uid=6000(hlk) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff), 0(wheel), 80(admin), 160(cvs)
[hlk@debian hlk]$ sudo -s
[root@debian hlk]#
[root@debian hlk]# id {\bf
uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel)} groups=0(wheel), 1(daemon), 20(staff), 80(admin)
[root@debian hlk]#
\end{alltt}

Note the difference between running as root and normal user. Usually books and instructions will use a prompt of hash mark \verb+#+ when the root user is assumed and dollar sign \verb+$+ when a normal user prompt.

\slide{Command syntax}

\begin{alltt}
echo [-n] [string ...]
\end{alltt}

\begin{list1}
\item Commands are written like this:
\begin{list2}
\item Always begin with the command to execute, like \verb+echo+ above
\item Options typically short form with single dash \verb+-n+
\item or long options \verb+--version+
\item Some commands allow grouing options, \verb+tar -c -v -f+ becomes \verb+tar -cvf+\\
NOTE: some options require parameters, so \verb+tar -c -f filename.tar+ not equal to \verb+tar -fc filename.tar+
\item Optional options are in brackets \verb+[ ]+
\item Output can be saved using redirection, into new file/overwrite \verb+echo hello > file.txt+ or append \verb+echo hello >> file.txt+
\item Read from files \verb+wc -l file.txt+ or pipe output into input \verb+cat file.txt | wc -l+\\
\verb+wc+ is word count, and option l is count lines
\end{list2}
\end{list1}



\slide{Unix Manual system}

\hlkimage{7cm}{images/Unix-command-1.pdf}

\begin{quote}
 It is a book about a Spanish guy called Manual. You should read it.
       -- Dilbert
\end{quote}

\begin{list1}
\item Manual system in Unix is always there!
\item Key word search \verb+man -k+ see also \verb+apropos+
\item Different sections, can be chosen
\end{list1}

See \verb+man crontab+ the command vs the file format in section 5 \verb+man 5 crontab+

NAME
     cal - displays a calendar
SYNOPSIS
     cal [-jy] [[month]  year]
DESCRIPTION
   cal displays a simple calendar.  If arguments are not specified, the cur-
   rent month is displayed.  The options are as follows:
   -j      Display julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January 1).
   -y      Display a calendar for the current year.

The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 on the 3rd
of September.  By this time, most countries had recognized the reforma-
tion (although a few did not recognize it until the early 1900's.)  Ten
days following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so the cal-
endar for that month is a bit unusual.

\hlkrightpic{8cm}{0cm}{Unix-vfs.pdf}
\begin{list2}
\item Command line is a requirement in the \emph{studieordningen} \smiley
\item Linux and Unix uses a single virtual file system\\

\item No drive letters like the ones in MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows
\item Everything starts at the root of the file system tree \verb+/+ - NOTE: \emph{forward slash}
\item One special directory is \verb+/etc/+ and sub directories which usually contain a lot of configuration files
\end{list2}

\slide{Installing software in Debian -- apt}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
DESCRIPTION
apt provides a high-level commandline interface for the package management system. It is intended as an end user interface
and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to more specialized APT tools like apt-get(8)
and apt-cache(8).

update (apt-get(8))
  update is used to download package information from all configured sources. Other commands operate on this data to e.g.
  perform package upgrades or search in and display details about all packages available for installation.

upgrade (apt-get(8))
  upgrade is used to install available upgrades of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources configured
  via sources.list(5). New packages will be installed if required to satisfy dependencies, but existing packages will never
  be removed. If an upgrade for a package requires the removal of an installed package the upgrade for this package isn't performed.

full-upgrade (apt-get(8))
  full-upgrade performs the function of upgrade but will remove currently installed packages if this is needed to upgrade the
  system as a whole.
\end{alltt}

\begin{list2}
  \item Install a program using apt, for example \verb+apt install nmap+
\end{list2}



\slide{Ansible}

\hlkimage{2cm}{Ansible_logo.png}

\begin{quote}
From my course materials:\\
Ansible is great for automating stuff, so by running the playbooks we can get a whole lot of programs installed, files modified - avoiding the Vi editor.
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Easy to read, even if you don't know much about YAML
\item \link{https://www.ansible.com/} and \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)}
\item Great documentation\\
 \link{https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/apt_module.html}
\end{list2}


\slide{Ansible Dependencies}

\hlkimage{10cm}{python-logo.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Ansible based on Python, only need Python installed\\
\link{https://www.python.org/}
\item Often you use Secure Shell for connecting to servers\\
\link{https://www.openssh.com/}
\item Easy to configure SSH keys, for secure connections
\end{list2}


\slide{Ansible playbooks}

Example playbook content, installing software using APT:
\begin{alltt}\small
apt:
    name: "\{\{ packages \}\}"
    vars:
      packages:
        - nmap
        - curl
        - iperf
        ...
\end{alltt}

Running it:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{shell}
cd kramse-labs/suricatazeek
ansible-playbook -v 1-dependencies.yml 2-suricatazeek.yml 3-elasticstack.yml 4-configuration.yml
\end{minted}

"YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data-serialization language."\\
\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML}

\slide{Python and YAML -- Git}

\hlkimage{7cm}{git-logo.png}

\begin{list2}
\item We need to store configurations
\item Run playbooks
\item Problem: Remember what we did, when, how
\item Solution: use git for the playbooks
\item Not the only version control system, but my preferred one
\end{list2}

\slide{Git getting started}

{\bf Hints:}\\
Browse the Git tutorials on \link{https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial}\\
and \link{https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/}

\begin{list2}
\item What is git
\item Terminology
\end{list2}

Note: you don't need an account on Github to download/clone repositories, but having an acccount allows you to save repositories yourself and is recommended.

\slide{Demo: Ansible, Python, Git!}

\begin{quote}
  Running Git will allow you to clone repositories from others easily. This is a great way to get new software packages, and share your own.

  Git is the name of the tool, and Github is a popular site for hosting git repositories.
\end{quote}


\begin{list2}
\item Go to \link{https://github.com/kramse/kramse-labs}
\item Lets explore while we talk
\item Install Git, Ansible and Python manually using apt
\item Then I will use Git to clone a repository
\item Using Ansible I can then run a playbook to install the Atom editor
\end{list2}

“It is said that despite its many glaring (and occasionally fatal) inaccuracies, the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy itself has outsold the Encyclopedia Galactica because it is slightly cheaper, and because it has the words ‘DON’T PANIC’ in large, friendly letters on the cover.”
