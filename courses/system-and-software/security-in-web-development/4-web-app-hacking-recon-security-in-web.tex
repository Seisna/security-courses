\slide{Selecting Technologies for your enterprise}

\hlkimage{14cm}{software.pdf}




\slide{Why talk about selecting technologies }

\hlkimage{7cm}{johnny_automatic_blueprints.png}


\begin{list2}
\item A big part of systems integration it to make sure applications can work together
\item Data interchange
\item Running systems require skills, many different technologies, many humans needed
\item Managing complexity with many systems become harder
\end{list2}

Later today we will discuss this subject more with the hand-in assigment

\slide{Exercise: Start selecting technologies -- 30min}

%\hlkimage{}{}

Think about your own choices, previously

Then think about creating a new template application
\begin{list2}
\item Which operating system, and why
\item Which language -- PHP, Python, Perl, Powershell, JavaScript, ...
\item Which supporting frameworks -- CSS, HTML, looks and compatability Bootstrap, Material, ...
\item Do you need databases and storage? SQL or No-SQL? why / why not
\item Other stuff to add? Git, Github, virtual machines, ...
\end{list2}

Prepare a short presentation (no slides) explaining why you would select those specific technologies. I will ask some of you, if you like to share with the class.

\slide{XML data}

\begin{quote}
  Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The World Wide Web Consortium's XML 1.0 Specification[2] of 1998[3] and several other related specifications[4]—all of them free open standards—define XML.[5]

  The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet.[6] It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures[7] such as those used in web services.
\end{quote}
Source: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML}

\begin{list2}
\item We have seen XML used for configuration in Apache Tomcat and Camel
\item Perfect for computers, less for humans
\end{list2}

\slide{XML data - documents}

\begin{quote}
Hundreds of document formats using XML syntax have been developed,[8] including RSS, Atom, SOAP, SVG, and XHTML. XML-based formats have become the default for many office-productivity tools, including Microsoft Office (Office Open XML), OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice (OpenDocument), and Apple's iWork[citation needed]. XML has also provided the base language for communication protocols such as XMPP. Applications for the Microsoft .NET Framework use XML files for configuration, and property lists are an implementation of configuration storage built on XML.[9]
\end{quote}
Source: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML}

\begin{list2}
\item Document formats using XML may still be proprietary!
\item Documents using XML can be validated, are they well-formed according to the Document Type Definition (DTD)
\end{list2}

\slide{Transforming XML using XSLT}
\begin{quote}


XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents,[1] or other formats such as HTML for web pages, plain text or XSL Formatting Objects, which may subsequently be converted to other formats, such as PDF, PostScript and PNG.[2] XSLT 1.0 is widely supported in modern web browsers.[3]
\end{quote}
Source: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT}

\begin{list2}
\item Can be seen as a mapping between formats, different XML schemas
\item Also is Turing complete, is a programming language
\end{list2}

\slide{XSLT example}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0">
  <xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes"/>
  <xsl:template match="/persons">
    <root> <xsl:apply-templates select="person"/> </root>
  </xsl:template>
  <xsl:template match="person">
    <name username="{@username}"> <xsl:value-of select="name" /> </name>
  </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
\end{minted}

\begin{list2}
\item XSLT uses XPath to identify subsets of the source document tree and perform calculations. XPath also provides a range of functions
\item XSLT functionalities overlap with those of XQuery, which was initially conceived as a query language for large collections of XML documents\\

\begin{list2}

\item \verb+apt install xsltproc+

\slide{Data overview JSON}

\begin{quote}
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON, pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/; also /ˈdʒeɪˌsɒn/[note 1]) is an open-standard file format or data interchange format that uses {\bf human-readable text} to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). It is a very common data format, with a diverse range of applications, such as serving as replacement for XML in AJAX systems.[6]
\end{quote}
Source: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON}

\begin{list2}
\item I like JSON much better than XML
\item Many web services can supply data in JSON format
\end{list2}

\slide{JSON example}

\item Dont import JSON or XML using home made programs
\item Example uses xml.etree.ElementTree from Python\\

root = tree.getroot()
mydict = etree_to_dict(root)
print(type(tree))

\begin{quote}
  RESTful services, also known as REST services, has become a popular architectural style
  used in modern enterprise projects. REST was defined by Roy Fielding in 2000 when
  he published his paper, and today REST is a foundation that drives the modern APIs
  on the web. You can also think of it as a modern web service, in which the APIs are
  RESTful and HTTP based so they’re easily consumable on the web.

\slide{TCP/IP and External Data Representation 1987}


\begin{quote}
External Data Representation (XDR) is a standard data serialization format, for uses such as computer network protocols. It allows data to be transferred between different kinds of computer systems. Converting from the local representation to XDR is called encoding. Converting from XDR to the local representation is called decoding.
