\slide{ 25. Defending Against Injection}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Previously we discussed the risk that injection-style attacks bring against web applications. These attacks are still common (although more common in the past), typically as a result of improper attention on the part of the developer writing any type of automation involving a CLI and user-submitted data.

Injection attacks also cover a wide surface area. Injection can be used against CLIs or any other isolated interpreter running on the server (when it hits the OS level, it becomes command injection instead). As a result, when considering how we will defend against injection-style attacks, it is easier to break such defensive measures up into a few categories.

SQL databases are still the most popular general-purpose database on the market. SQL query language is strict, but reliably fast and easy to learn. SQL can be used for anything from storage of user credentials to managing JSON objects or small image blobs. The largest of these are PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and SQLite.

\begin{quote}
If database error messages are sent to the client directly, a similar technique to the one for detecting server packages can be used to determine the database. Often this is not the case, so you must find an alternative discovery route.
...
One technique that can be used is primary key scanning. Most databases support the notion of a “primary key,” which refers to a key in a table (SQL) or document (NoSQL) that is generated automatically upon object creation and used for rapidly performing lookups in the database.

\slide{Attacking Injection Summary -- SQL Injection and PHP}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
One of the most commonly known types of attacks against a web application is SQL injection. SQL injection is a type of injection attack that specifically targets SQL databases, allowing a malicious user to either provide their own parameters to an existing SQL query, or to escape an SQL query and provide their own query. {\bf Naturally, this typically results in a compromised database because of the escalated permissions the SQL interpreter is given by default.}
...

Old-school PHP developers would interweave a combination of
SQL, HTML, and PHP into their PHP files—an organizational model supported by
PHP that would be misused, resulting in an enormous amount of vulnerable PHP
code.
...

In more recent years, PHP coding standards have become much more strict and the
language has implemented tools to reduce the odds of SQL injection occurring.

\slide{Attacking Injection Summary -- SQL Injection and Other languages}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
The result of these developments is that there is less SQL injection across the entire web. In fact, injection vulnerabilities have decreased from nearly 5\% of all vulnerabilities in 2010 to less than 1\% of all vulnerabilities found today, according to the National Vulnerability Database.

The security lessons learned from PHP have lived on in other languages, and it is much more difficult to find SQL injection vulnerabilities in today’s web applications.

It is still possible, however, and still common in applications that do not make use of secure coding best practices.

\slide{Role-based Access Control (RBAC)}

\begin{quote}
In computer systems security, {\bf role-based access control (RBAC)}[1][2] or role-based security[3] is an approach to restricting system access to unauthorized users. It is used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees,[4] and can implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around {\bf roles and privileges}. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments. A study by NIST has demonstrated that RBAC addresses many needs of commercial and government organizations[citation needed]. RBAC can be used to facilitate administration of security in large organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions. Although RBAC is different from MAC and DAC access control frameworks, it can enforce these policies without any complication.

\slide{Prepared Statements -- what it is}

\begin{quote}
One development that most SQL implementations have begun to support is prepared statements. Prepared statements reduce a significant amount of risk when using user-supplied data in an SQL query. Beyond this, prepared statements are very easy to learn and make debugging SQL queries much easier.

Prepared statements work by compiling the query first, with placeholder values for variables. These are known as bind variables, but are often just referred to as placeholder variables. After compiling the query, the placeholders are replaced with the values provided by the developer. As a result of this two-step process, the intention of the query is set before any user-submitted data is considered.

\slide{Prepared Statements -- what it provides and how to use}

In MySQL, prepared statements are quite simple:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{sql}
PREPARE q FROM 'SELECT name, barCode from products WHERE price <= ?';
SET @price = 12;
EXECUTE q USING @price;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE q;
\end{minted}

\begin{quote}
With a prepared statement, because the intention is set in stone prior to the user-submitted data being presented to the SQL interpreter, the query itself cannot change. {\bf This means that a SELECT operation against users cannot be escaped and modified into a DELETE operation by any means.} An {\bf additional query cannot occur after the SELECT operation} if the user escapes the original query and begins a new one. {\bf Prepared statements eliminate most SQL injection risk} and are supported by almost every major SQL database: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.

\slide{Use Object–relational mapping (ORM)}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Object–relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perfor object–relational mapping, although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tools.

\slide{Django SQL injection protection}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
SQL injection protection¶
SQL injection is a type of attack where a malicious user is able to execute arbitrary SQL code on a database. This can result in records being deleted or data leakage.

Django’s querysets are protected from SQL injection since their queries are constructed using query parameterization. A query’s SQL code is defined separately from the query’s parameters. Since parameters may be user-provided and therefore unsafe, they are escaped by the underlying database driver.

Django also gives developers power to write raw queries or execute custom sql. These capabilities should be used sparingly and you should always be careful to properly escape any parameters that the user can control. In addition, you should exercise caution when using extra() and RawSQL.

\slide{26. Defending Against DoS}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
DoS attacks usually involve the {\bf use of system resources}, which can make detecting
them a bit difficult without robust server logging. It can be {\bf difficult to detect a DoS
attack that occurred in the past} if it came through legitimate channels (such as an API
endpoint).
As such, a first measure against DoS-style attacks should be {\bf building up a comprehensive enough logging system} in your server that all requests are logged alongside their time to respond. You should also manually log the performance of any type of async “job"-style functions, such as a backup that is called through your API but runs in the background and does not generate a response once it completes. Doing this will allow you to find any attempts (accidental or malicious) at exploiting a DoS vulnerability (server side) that would have otherwise been difficult and time-consuming.
\end{quote}
Source: \emph{Web Application Security}, Andrew Hoffman, 2020, ISBN: 9781492053118

\begin{list2}
\item Denial of service can be the result of any resource running out, CPU, memory, bandwidth, interrupt handling, session table, open files, open TCP connections, database connection, running out of random bits for keys, running out of file nodes in the file system, ...
\end{list2}


\slide{Protecting Against Regex DoS}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Regex DoS attacks are likely the easiest form of DoS to defend against, but require prior knowledge of how the attacks are structured (as shown in Part II of this book). With a proper code review process, you can prevent regex DoS sinks (evil or malicious regex) from ever entering your codebase.
...

The second step is to make sure there are no places in your application where a {\bf user-supplied regex is utilized}. Allowing user-uploaded regular expressions is like walking through a minefield and hoping you memorized the safe-route map correctly. It will take a huge coordinated effort to maintain such a system, and it is generally an all-around bad idea from a security perspective.
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Have a timeout for all potentially long running tasks, shut them down
\item Measure time taken for requests, mark those taking too long -- prevent them from running again, too often
\item Any search form can be a trigger!
\end{list2}


\slide{Protecting Against Logical DoS}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Logical DoS is much more difficult to detect and prevent than regex DoS. Much like regex DoS, logical DoS is not exploitable under most circumstances unless your developers accidentally introduce a segment of logic that can be abused to eat up system resources.
...

In order to protect against logical DoS, we need to identify the areas of our codebase in which critical system resources are utilized.
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item I think client attacks in this category should include mining various cryptocoins
\end{list2}



\slide{Protecting Against DDoS}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) are much more difficult to defend
against than DoS attacks that originate from a single attacker. While single-target DoS
attacks often target a bug in application code (like an improperly written regex, or a
resource-hogging API call), DDoS attacks are usually much simpler by nature.
Most DDoS attacks on the web originate from multiple sources, but are controlled by
a centralized source. This is orchestrated via a single attacker or group of attackers
who distribute malware by some channel.

\item I have multiple presentations about this area, in general, it is hard to protect your site
