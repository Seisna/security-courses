\slide{Separation of duty ns function}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Separation of duties} (SoD; also known as Segregation of Duties) is the concept of having more than one person required to complete a task. In business the separation by sharing of more than one individual in one single task is an internal control intended to prevent fraud and error.
\end{quote}

Quote from \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_duties}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Separation of function}. Developers do not develop new programs on production systems because of the potential threat to production data.

Danish: Funktionsadskillelse



\slide{Accuracy vs disclosure}

Lipner five commercial requirements:
\begin{list2}
\item[1.] Users will not write their own programs, but use existing
  production software.
\item[2.] Programmers develop and test applications on a nonproduction system, possibly using contrived data.
\item[3.] Moving applications from development to production requires a special process.
\item[4.] This process must be controlled and audited.
\item[5.] Managers and auditors must have access to system state and system logs
\end{list2}

\slide{The Biba Model}

Ken Biba (1977) proposed three different integrity access control
policies.

\begin{list2}
\item[1] The Low Water Mark Integrity Policy
\item[2] The Ring Policy
\item[3] Strict Integrity
\item All assume that we associate integrity labels with subjects and
objects, analogous to clearance levels in BLP.
\item Only Strict Integrity had much continuing influence. It is the one
typically referred to as the “Biba Model” or “Biba Integrity.”

A {\bf well-formed transaction} from one consistent state to another consistent state.

\begin{list2}
\item Constrained Data Items: CDIs are the objects whose
integrity is protected
\item Unconstrained Data Items: UDIs are objects not covered by
the integrity policy
\item Transformation Procedures: TPs are the only procedures
allowed to modify CDIs, or take arbitrary user input and
create new CDIs. Designed to take the system from one valid
state to another.
\item Integrity Verification Procedures: IVPs are procedures
meant to verify maintainance of integrity of CDIs.

\slide{Clark-Wilson Integrity Model}

\begin{quote}
The model uses a three-part relationship of subject/program/object (where program is interchangeable with transaction) known as a triple or an access control triple. Within this relationship, subjects do not have direct access to objects. Objects can only be accessed through programs

Securing Administrative User Accounts}\\
Managing users is one of the more {\bf challenging} aspects of IT administration. You need to make sure
that users can always {\bf access their stuff} and that they can {\bf perform the required tasks} to do their jobs.
You also need to ensure that users’ stuff is always {\bf secure from unauthorized users} and that users  {\bf can’t perform any tasks that don’t fit their job description}.

\item The dangers of logging in as the root user
\item The advantages of using sudo
\item Setting up sudo privileges for full administrative users and for users with only certain dele-

\slide{The dangers of logging in as the root user}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
A huge advantage that Unix and Linux operating systems have over Windows is that Unix and Linux do
a much better job of keeping privileged administrative accounts separated from normal user accounts.
Indeed, one reason that older versions of Windows were so susceptible to security issues, such as
drive-by virus infections, was the common practice of setting up user accounts with administrative
privileges, without having the protection of the User Access Control (UAC) that’s in newer versions of
Windows.
\end{quote}
Source: \emph{Mastering Linux Security and Hardening} (MLSH), third edition

\begin{list2}
\item Agreed, but I may be biased
\item Mac OS X made it very simple to run administrative tasks, so you didn't need to run as root
\item Modern Linux user interfaces make similar attempts with \verb+pkexec+, \verb+kdesudo+,  \verb+gksudo+ etc.
\item Windows is getting better, many organisations in DK are removing administrative access to regular users, even KEA
\end{list2}

\slide{The advantages of using sudo}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Used properly, the sudo utility can greatly enhance the security of your systems, and it can make an
administrator’s job much easier. With sudo , you can do the following:
\begin{list2}
\item Assign certain users full administrative privileges, while assigning other users only the privi-
leges they need to perform tasks that are directly related to their respective jobs.
\item Allow users to perform administrative tasks by entering their own normal user passwords so
that you don’t have to distribute the root password to everybody and their brother.
\item Make it harder for intruders to break into your systems. If you implement sudo and disable
the root user account, would-be intruders won’t know which account to attack because they
won’t know which one has admin privileges.
\item Create sudo policies that you can deploy across an entire enterprise network, even if that
network has a mix of Unix, BSD, and Linux machines.
\item Improve your auditing capabilities because you’ll be able to see what users are doing with
their admin privileges.
\end{list2}
\end{quote}
Source: \emph{Mastering Linux Security and Hardening} (MLSH), third edition

\slide{Why use Sudo conclusion}

Main thing about sudo is that you do NOT give out the root password to anybody! They will use their own credentials and can be limited to single commands, scripts and even parameters. You could have a single sudoers file for your own organisation, that includes groups of servers, user groups etc.

Sidenote: sudo also has a number of CVEs unfortunately

\slide{Setting up sudo privileges}

%\hlkimage{}{}

Chapter has multiple example of configuration. Mostly we add users to a predefined admin group, but for my personal systems I add named users with privileges - user \emph{hlk}

As an exercise, if you haven't done before -- make sure sudo works on your Kali and Debian. If it is pre-configured, check the settings, how did this happen?

Debian usually does NOT come with sudo installed, so -verb+apt install sudo+

\begin{list2}
\item Lets do a few of the commands from chapter 2, check sudo on your systems
\item Always use the command \verb+visudo+ to edit your sudoers file! Checks syntax, and you avoid locking yourself out!
\item I recommend the book: \emph{Sudo Mastery}, 2nd Edition by Michael W Lucas, \\

Enforcing strong password criteria
You wouldn’t think that a benign-sounding topic such as strong password criteria would be so contro-
versial, but it is. The conventional wisdom that you’ve undoubtedly heard for your entire computer
career says:

\begin{list2}
\item Make passwords of a certain minimum length.
\item Make passwords that consist of a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers,
and special characters.
\item Ensure that passwords don’t contain any words that are found in the dictionary or that are
based on the users’ own personal data.
\item Force users to change their passwords on a regular basis.
\end{list2}

\slide{Unix systems are mostly single-user part I}

\begin{list2}
\item Fewer and fewer Unix systems, including Linux are multi-user systems today
\item Chapter is still important, but less so for now, use it as a reference later
\item Password policies are relevant for all systems, single or multi user
\item Pro-tip use Ansible or similar to configure all systems

\begin{list1}
\item Dont:
\begin{list2}
\item Reinvent the wheel - too many times, unless you can maintain it afterwards
\item Never invent cryptography yourself
\item No copy paste of functionality, harder to maintain in the future
\end{list2}
\item Do:
\begin{list2}
\item Integrate with existing solutions
\item Use existing well-tested code: cryptography, authentication, hashing
\item Centralize security in your code
\item Fine to hide which authentication framework is being used, easy to replace later

\slide{Cisco IOS password 2013}

\begin{quote}
Title: Cisco's new password hashing scheme easily cracked\\

Description: In an astonishing decision that has left crytographic
experts scratching their heads, engineer's for Cisco's IOS operating
system chose to switch to a {\bf one-time SHA256 encoding - without salt} -
for storing passwords on the device. This decision leaves password
hashes vulnerable to high-speed cracking - modern graphics cards can
compute over {\bf 2 billion SHA256 hashes in a second - and is actually
considerably less secure than Cisco's previous implementation.} As users
cannot downgrade their version of IOS without a complete reinstall, and
no fix is yet available, security experts are urging users to avoid
upgrades to IOS version 15 at this time.

\item og sikkert 25-30\% indenfor den første dag - hvis der ingen
  politik er omkring kodeord!
\item ved at generere store tabeller, eksempelvis 100GB kan man dække
  mange hashværdier af passwords med almindelige bogstaver, tal og

supported out of the box are Kerberos AFS and Windows NT/2000/XP/2003
LM hashes, plus several more with contributed patches.
