\hlkimage{10cm}{thomas-drouault-IBUcu_9vXJc-unsplash.jpg}

You will need in your group -- 2-3 persons is recommended:
Docker or similar container technology, Browser -- researching stuff on the internet

I will use a virtual machine with Debian 12 Bookworm for this! Most exercises can be executed from this VM. You may be able to run exercises from your normal operating system, but it may take longer than just adding a Debian VM and doing it.

\hlkimage{6cm}{dont-panic.png}

\begin{quote}
“It is said that despite its many glaring (and occasionally fatal) inaccuracies, the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy itself has outsold the Encyclopedia Galactica because it is slightly cheaper, and because it has the words ‘DON’T PANIC’ in large, friendly letters on the cover.”
\end{quote}
Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams


\slide{Your lab setup}

\begin{list2}
\item Go to GitHub, Find user Kramse, click through security-courses, find the software-security folder\\
\link{https://github.com/kramse/security-courses/tree/master/courses/system-and-software/software-security}
\item Look into the files named: \verb+intro-to-it-security-week-7.pdf+, \verb+intro-to-it-security-week-8.pdf+ and \verb+intro-to-it-security-exercises.pdf+
\item Install Docker on a laptop in your team -- you might already have it
\end{list2}

Hint: If you have a Debian virtual machine you can install the docker software as a package using the Ansible tool, by checking out a repo \verb+kramse-labs+ and running Ansible:
\begin{alltt}
sudo apt install ansible git
git clone https://github.com/kramse/kramse-labs.git
cd docker-install
ansible-playbook -v 1-dependencies.yml
\end{alltt}


\slide{Why introduce Git and Github?}

We introduce Git here also because Github, one of the most popular places to store Git repositories has added security tools which you can use.

An example of a security feature at Github is the use of dependencies, when a project is stored on Github they can scan for outdated dependencies which have security issues.

You can read more about the features available, and some common problems in software in their article:
\emph{How GitHub secures open source software}

\slide{Command prompts in Unix}

\begin{list1}
\item Shells :
  \begin{list2}
    \item sh - Bourne Shell
\item bash - Bourne Again Shell, often the default in Linux
\item ksh - Korn shell, original by David Korn, but often the public domain version used
\item csh - C shell, syntax similar to C language
\item Multiple others available, zsh is very popular
  \end{list2}
\item Windows have \verb+command.com+, \verb+cmd.exe+ but PowerShell is more similar to the Unix shells
\item Used for scripting, automation and programs
\end{list1}



\slide{Command prompts}


\begin{alltt}
\small
[hlk@fischer hlk]$ id
uid=6000(hlk) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),
0(wheel), 80(admin), 160(cvs)
[hlk@fischer hlk]$ sudo -s
[root@fischer hlk]#
[root@fischer hlk]# id {\bf
uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel)} groups=0(wheel), 1(daemon),
20(staff), 80(admin)
[root@fischer hlk]#
\end{alltt}

Note the difference between running as root and normal user. Usually books and instructions will use a prompt of hash mark \verb+#+ when the root user is assumed and dollar sign \verb+$+ when a normal user prompt.

\slide{Command syntax}


\begin{alltt}
echo [-n] [string ...]
\end{alltt}

\begin{list1}
\item Commands are written like this:
\begin{list2}
\item Always begin with the command to execute, like \verb+echo+ above
\item Options typically short form with single dash \verb+-n+
\item or long options \verb+--version+
\item Some commands allow grouing options, \verb+tar -c -v -f+ becomes \verb+tar -cvf+\\
NOTE: some options require parameters, so \verb+tar -c -f filename.tar+ not equal to \verb+tar -fc filename.tar+
\item Optional options are in brackets \verb+[ ]+
\item Output can be saved using redirection, into new file/overwrite \verb+echo hello > file.txt+ or append \verb+echo hello >> file.txt+
\item Read from files \verb+wc -l file.txt+ or pipe output into input \verb+cat file.txt | wc -l+\\
\verb+wc+ is word count, and option l is count lines
\end{list2}
\end{list1}



\slide{Unix Manual system}

\hlkimage{7cm}{images/Unix-command-1.pdf}

\begin{quote}
 It is a book about a Spanish guy called Manual. You should read it.
       -- Dilbert
\end{quote}

\begin{list1}
\item Manual system in Unix is always there!
\item Key word search \verb+man -k+ see also \verb+apropos+
\item Different sections, can be chosen
\end{list1}

See \verb+man crontab+ the command vs the file format in section 5 \verb+man 5 crontab+

NAME
     cal - displays a calendar
SYNOPSIS
     cal [-jy] [[month]  year]
DESCRIPTION
   cal displays a simple calendar.  If arguments are not specified, the cur-
   rent month is displayed.  The options are as follows:
   -j      Display julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January 1).
   -y      Display a calendar for the current year.

The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 on the 3rd
of September.  By this time, most countries had recognized the reforma-
tion (although a few did not recognize it until the early 1900's.)  Ten
days following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so the cal-
endar for that month is a bit unusual.

\slide{Installing software in Debian -- apt}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
DESCRIPTION
apt provides a high-level commandline interface for the package management system. It is intended as an end user interface
and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to more specialized APT tools like apt-get(8)
and apt-cache(8).

update (apt-get(8))
  update is used to download package information from all configured sources. Other commands operate on this data to e.g.
  perform package upgrades or search in and display details about all packages available for installation.

upgrade (apt-get(8))
  upgrade is used to install available upgrades of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources configured
  via sources.list(5). New packages will be installed if required to satisfy dependencies, but existing packages will never
  be removed. If an upgrade for a package requires the removal of an installed package the upgrade for this package isn't performed.

full-upgrade (apt-get(8))
  full-upgrade performs the function of upgrade but will remove currently installed packages if this is needed to upgrade the
  system as a whole.
\end{alltt}

\begin{list2}
  \item Install a program using apt, for example \verb+apt install nmap+
\end{list2}


\slide{Ansible}

\hlkimage{2cm}{Ansible_logo.png}

\begin{quote}
From my course materials:\\
Ansible is great for automating stuff, so by running the playbooks we can get a whole lot of programs installed, files modified - avoiding the Vi editor.

\begin{list2}
\item Easy to read, even if you don't know much about YAML
\item \link{https://www.ansible.com/} and \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)}
\item Great documentation\\
 \link{https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/apt_module.html}
\end{list2}


\slide{Ansible Dependencies}

\hlkimage{10cm}{python-logo.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Ansible based on Python, only need Python installed\\
\link{https://www.python.org/}
\item Often you use Secure Shell for connecting to servers\\
\link{https://www.openssh.com/}
\item Easy to configure SSH keys, for secure connections
\end{list2}


\slide{Ansible playbooks}

Example playbook content, installing software using APT:
\begin{alltt}\small
apt:
    name: "\{\{ packages \}\}"
    vars:
      packages:
        - nmap
        - curl
        - iperf
        ...
\end{alltt}

Running it:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{shell}

\begin{quote}
  Running Git will allow you to clone repositories from others easily. This is a great way to get new software packages, and share your own.

  Git is the name of the tool, and Github is a popular site for hosting git repositories.

\begin{list1}
\item It is not paranoia when:
\begin{list2}
\item Criminals sell your credit card information and identity theft
\item Trade infected computers like a commodity
\item Governments write laws that allows them to introduce back-doors - and use these
\item Governments do blanket surveillance of their population, implement censorship, threaten citizens and journalist

\slide{XZ backdoor}

This month, only days ago it surfaced that someone injected backdoors into some software named XZ.
\emph{Inside the failed attempt to backdoor SSH globally — that got caught by chance}

\begin{quote}
What happened here is now well documented elsewhere, so I shall not recap it much, but essentially somebody appears to have hijacked the open source XZ project by social engineering the volunteer developer into handing over maintainer access after they cited some mental health issues, used the package XZ Utils to piggy back into systemd loading liblzma, which in turn loaded XZ, allowing sshd to be hooked to trojan it on Linux distributions that use systemd.

The {\bf trojan allows somebody a private key to hijack sshd to execute commands}, amongst other functions. It is highly advanced.

\hlkimage{15cm}{god-sikkerhed.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item You always have limited resources for protection - use them as best as possible
\end{list1}



\slide{Recommendations}

\begin{list1}
\item {\bf Keep updated!}\\ - read web sites, books, articles, mailing lists, Twitter, ...
\item {\bf Always have a chapter on security evaluation }\\ - any process must have security, like RFC Request for Comments have
\item {\bf Incident Response}\\ - you WILL have security incidents, be prepared
\item {\bf Write down security policy}\\ - including software and e-mail policies
\end{list1}

\slide{Advice}

\begin{list1}
\item Use technology
\item Learn the technology - read the freaking manual
\item Think about the data you have, upload, facebook license?! WTF!
\item Think about the data you create
\begin{list2}
\item Turn off features you don't use
\item Turn off network connections when not in use
\item Update software and applications
\item Turn on encryption: IMAP{\bf S}, POP3{\bf S},
  HTTP{\bf S} also for data at rest, full disk encryption, tablet encryption
\item Lock devices automatically when not used for 10 minutes
\item Dont trust fancy logins like fingerprint scanner or face recognition on cheap devices
\end{list2}

But which features to disable? Let the security principles guide you

\slide{Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability}

\hlkimage{8cm}{cia-triad-uk.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item We want to protect something
\item Confidentiality - data kept a secret
\item Integrity - data is not subjected to unauthorized changes
\item Availability - data and systems are available when needed
\end{list1}


\slide{Work together}

\hlkimage{9cm}{Shaking-hands_web.jpg}

\begin{list1}
\item Team up!
\item We need to share security information freely
\item We often face the same threats, so we can work on solving these together
\end{list1}

\slide{Goals of Security}

\begin{list1}
\item Prevention - means that an attack will fail
\item Detection - determine if attack is underway, or has occured - report it
\item Recovery - stop attack, assess damage, repair damage
\end{list1}

Policy and Mechanism

\begin{quote}
{\bf Definition 1-1.} A \emph{security policy} is a statement of what is, and what is not, allowed.

{\bf Definition 1-2.} A \emph{security mechanism} is a method, tool or procedure for enforcing a security policy.

Quote from Matt Bishop, Computer Security section 1.3


\slide{Balanced security}

\hlkimage{21cm}{afbalanceret-sikkerhed.pdf}

\item Better to have the same level of security
\item If you have bad security in some part - guess where attackers will end up
\item Hackers are not required to take the hardest path into the network
\item Realize there is no such thing as 100\% security

\slide{Morris Internet Worm - 30 years ago}

\begin{list1}
\item Used multiple vulnerabilities:
\begin{list2}
\item Sendmail Debug functionality, we have similar things and Google Hacking
\item Buffer overflow in fingerd, we still have those
\item Weak passwords/password cracking, list of 432 words and /usr/dict/words, same problem today
\item Trust between systems rsh, rexec, think Domain Admin today
\item Found new systems using /etc/hosts.equiv, .rhosts, .forward, netstat ...
\end{list2}
\item Also known as the Morris Internet Worm
\item \emph{The Internet Worm Program: An Analysis}\\
Purdue Technical Report CSD-TR-823, Eugene H. Spafford
\item Resulted in creation of the CERT, \link{http://www.cert.org}

\slide{Internet Worms history repeats itself}

\begin{list1}
\item Camouflage, tried to hide, malware today hides as well
\begin{list2}
\item Program name set to 'sh', looks like a regular shell
\item Used fork() to change process ID (PID)
\item Worms in the 2000s spread quickly, like Code Red 2001 to approx 350.000 systems in a week
\item SQL Slammer "It spread rapidly, infecting most of its 75,000 victims within ten minutes."
\end{list2}
\vskip 1cm
\item New malware today can use the same strategies
\item Except a lot of malware tries to stay hidden, less noisy
\item Using a small password list of 50 words it is possible to create your own botnet with 100.000s
\end{list1}


\slide{Trusted Computing Base}

{\bf Definition 20-6.} A \emph{trusted computing base} (TCB) consists of all protection mechanisms within a computer system -- including hardware, firmware, and software -- that are responsible for enforcing a security policy

Quote from Matt Bishop, Computer Security

Keeping this small, simple and understandable help keeping systems more secure.

Example the Qubes OS depend on few security-critical components:\\
