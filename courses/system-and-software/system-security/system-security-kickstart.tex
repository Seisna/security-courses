This material is prepared for use in \emph{\subject} and was prepared by
Henrik Kramselund, \url{xhek@kea.dk}.
It contains the very basic information to get started!

These course and exercises are expected to be performed in a training setting with network connected systems. The exercises use a number of tools which can be copied and reused after training. A lot is described about setting up your workstation in the Github repositories.
