\slide{Accuracy vs disclosure}

Lipner five commercial requirements:
\begin{list2}
\item[1.] Users will not write their own programs, but use existing
  production software.
\item[2.] Programmers develop and test applications on a nonproduction system, possibly using contrived data.
\item[3.] Moving applications from development to production requires a special process.
\item[4.] This process must be controlled and audited.
\item[5.] Managers and auditors must have access to system state and system logs
\end{list2}

\slide{Separation of duty ns function}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Separation of duties} (SoD; also known as Segregation of Duties) is the concept of having more than one person required to complete a task. In business the separation by sharing of more than one individual in one single task is an internal control intended to prevent fraud and error.
\end{quote}

Quote from \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_duties}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Separation of function}. Developers do not develop new programs on production systems because of the potential threat to production data.
\end{quote}
\emph{Computer Security}, Matt Bishop, 2019

\slide{The Biba Model}

Ken Biba (1977) proposed three different integrity access control
policies.

\begin{list2}
\item[1] The Low Water Mark Integrity Policy
\item[2] The Ring Policy
\item[3] Strict Integrity
\item All assume that we associate integrity labels with subjects and
objects, analogous to clearance levels in BLP.
\item Only Strict Integrity had much continuing influence. It is the one
typically referred to as the “Biba Model” or “Biba Integrity.”
\end{list2}

\slide{Clark-Wilson Integrity Model}

A {\bf well-formed transaction} from one consistent state to another consistent state.

\begin{list2}
\item Constrained Data Items: CDIs are the objects whose
integrity is protected
\item Unconstrained Data Items: UDIs are objects not covered by
the integrity policy
\item Transformation Procedures: TPs are the only procedures
allowed to modify CDIs, or take arbitrary user input and
create new CDIs. Designed to take the system from one valid
state to another.
\item Integrity Verification Procedures: IVPs are procedures
meant to verify maintainance of integrity of CDIs.
\end{list2}

\emph{A Comparison of Commercial and Military Computer Security Policies},
David D. Clark and David R. Wilson, 1987

\slide{Clark-Wilson rules}


\begin{list22}
\item[Certification rule 1] —When an IVP is executed, it must ensure the CDIs are valid.
\item[Certification rule 2] —For some associated set of CDIs, a TP must transform those CDIs from one valid state to another.
Since we must make sure that these TPs are certified to operate on a particular CDI, we must have E1 and E2.

\item[Enforcement rule 1] —System must maintain a list of certified relations and ensure only TPs certified to run on a CDI change that CDI.
\item[Enforcement rule 2] —System must associate a user with each TP and set of CDIs. The TP may access the CDI on behalf of the user if it is "legal".
\item[Enforcement rule 3] -The system must authenticate the identity of each user attempting to execute a TP.
This requires keeping track of triples (user, TP, {CDIs}) called "allowed relations".

\item[Certification rule 3] —Allowed relations must meet the requirements of "separation of duty".
We need authentication to keep track of this.

\item[Certification rule 4] —All TPs must append to a log enough information to reconstruct the operation.
When information enters the system it need not be trusted or constrained (i.e. can be a UDI). We must deal with this appropriately.

\item[Certification rule 5] —Any TP that takes a UDI as input may only perform valid transactions for all possible values of the UDI. The TP will either accept (convert to CDI) or reject the UDI.
Finally, to prevent people from gaining access by changing qualifications of a TP:

\item[Enforcement rule 4] —Only the certifier of a TP may change the list of entities associated with that TP.
\end{list22}


\slide{Clark-Wilson Integrity Model}

\begin{quote}
The model uses a three-part relationship of subject/program/object (where program is interchangeable with transaction) known as a triple or an access control triple. Within this relationship, subjects do not have direct access to objects. Objects can only be accessed through programs
\end{quote}

\slide{Availability Policies}

\begin{list1}
\item An availability policy ensures that a resource or service can be accessed in some way in a timely fashion
\item Often expressed as \emph{quality of service}
\item Denial of service occurs when this resource or service becomes unavailable
\end{list1}

\slide{Relational Database Management System RDBMS}

\hlkimage{7cm}{RDBMS_structure.png}

\begin{list1}
\item Relational Database Management System RDBMS is a common database architecture
\item Common examples MS-SQL, MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL
\item Picture: By Scifipete - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0,\\ \url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11506013}

\slide{Deadlocks}

\begin{list1}
\item {\bf Definition 7-1} A \emph{deadlock} is a state in which some set of processes block, each waiting for another process in the set to take some action.
\begin{list2}
\item[1.] The resource is not shared (mutual exclusion)
\item[2.] An entity must hold the resource and block, waiting until another resource becomes available (hold and wait)
\item[3.] A resource being help cannot be released (no preemption)
\item[4.] A set of entities must be holding resources such that each entity is waiting for a resource held by another entity in the set (circular wait)
\end{list2}
\item Often found in Relational Database Systems, if two processes want to update two tables, and each one has a write lock on one table, waiting for the write lock on the other
\item See also \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock}
\end{list1}

\slide{Common Discusssion}

Databases - discussion about Relational Database Management System RDBMS Model and NoSQL databases, which ones do you and your company use?

\slide{Fairness and starvation}

\begin{list1}
\item Fairness policy prevents starvation, often rephrased as - process will make progress
\item If one process gets all resources, memory, cpu, network the others will starve - not have enough resources to progress
\item Compare to old operating systems Windows 3 / Mac OS 9\\
Cooperative multitasking vs pre-emptive multitasking
\end{list1}

\slide{Availability and Network flooding attacks}

\begin{list2}
\item Our book spends some time on SYN and other flooding attacks
\item SYN flood is the most basic and very common on the internet towards 80/tcp and 443/tcp
\item ICMP and UDP flooding are the next targets
\item Supporting litterature is TCP Synfloods - an old yet current problem, and improving pf's response to it, Henning Brauer, BSDCan 2017
\item All of them try to use up some resources
\begin{list2}
\item Memory space in specific sections of the kernel, TCP state, firewalls state, number of concurrent sessions/connections
\item interrupt processing of packets - packets per second
\item CPU processing in firewalls, pps
\item CPU processing in server software
\item Bandwidth - megabits per second mbps
\end{list2}
