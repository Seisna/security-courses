# General feedback on the mandatory assignment


## Goals

One of the goals was to put you out of your comfort zone.

Having to analyze a disk image, without the proper tools. Later in the course we actually then mentioned tools that could be used. Being in this position you had to research for yourself.

Fortunately this is an exercise, so not a real live critical system. You could relax more.

Also, this mimics a normal situation, suddenly you have to do X, for the first time.


## Learnings

You probably learned that even though you could grasp the concepts, actually doing it required more. Attention to details, disks, partitions, etc. while tools might have some missing features - all modern Linux systems use LVM Logical Volume Manager, which Autopsy does NOT support.

You also learned that forensics is time consuming, and I did try to warn you

"The process should be possible to complete in less than 10 hours, but you are welcome to do more."

So if you did much more, then you probably should have asked for help from instructor or fellow students.

## Side notes and history

This exercise is partly inspired by the Bishop book, the "back door SUID shell", but also from a forensic challenge by The Honeynet Project.

This challenge was a Forensic Challenge:

Take special note of the "results"
http://www.all.net/journal/deception/www.honeynet.org/project.honeynet.org/challenge/results/index.html

"The average time spent in investigation turned out to be about 34 hours per person. That's a standard week's worth of work to clean up and deal with the mess left by an intruder in about a half an hour. That's about a 60:1 ratio! Using a standard upper-mid range annual salary figure of US$70,000 per investigator, that works out to be a cleanup cost of over US$2000 for a single incident. It is very likely one of dozens, if not hundreds, of intrusions just like it. As you will see when you read the analyses, this wasn't the first time this intruder did this."

They spent 60 times more analyzing the image, than the attacker spent!

So your experience is not far from what others have experienced. Even though some people probably took the opportunity to learn, and used more hours.
