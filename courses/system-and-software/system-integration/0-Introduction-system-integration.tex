\begin{quote}
"That's why Bobby Woolf and I documented a pattern language consisting of 65 integration patterns to establish a technology-independent vocabulary and a visual notation to design and document integration solutions. Each pattern not only presents a proven solution to a recurring problem, but also documents common "gotchas" and design considerations.

The patterns are brought to life with examples implemented in messaging technologies, such as JMS, SOAP, MSMQ, .NET, and other EAI Tools. The solutions are relevant for a wide range of integration tools and platforms, such as IBM WebSphere MQ, TIBCO, Vitria, WebMethods (Software AG), or Microsoft BizTalk, messaging systems, such as JMS, WCF, Rabbit MQ, or MSMQ, ESB's such as Apache Camel, Mule, WSO2, Oracle Service Bus, Open ESB, SonicMQ, Fiorano or Fuse ServiceMix."

\begin{list2}
\item It will be great to have virtualisation running, to try various systems
\item Hardware: modern laptop CPU with virtualisation\\
Dont forget to enable hardware virtualisation in the BIOS
\item Virtualisation software: VMware, Virtual box, HyperV pick your poison

\slide{Command prompt}

We will use Unix/Linux systems, and you need to use the command line a bit:

\begin{alltt}
\small
[hlk@fischer hlk]$ id
uid=6000(hlk) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),
0(wheel), 80(admin), 160(cvs)
[hlk@fischer hlk]$

[root@fischer hlk]# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel), 1(daemon),
2(kmem), 3(sys), 4(tty), 5(operator), 20(staff),
31(guest), 80(admin)
[root@fischer hlk]#
\end{alltt}

\begin{list1}
\item \verb+$+ is commonly used for showing a user login, while a \verb+#+ is for root logins
\item Change from user to root using the command \verb+sudo+ like \verb+sudo -s+
\end{list1}

\slide{Command Syntax}

A common syntax for commands are described like this:
\begin{alltt}
echo [-n] [string ...]
\end{alltt}

\begin{list2}
\item The command is the first thing on the command line, you cannot write \verb+henrik echo+
\item Options are prefixed with dash \verb+-n+, optional ones are in brackets  \verb+[]+
\item Multiple options can be combined into one group like, \verb+tar -cvf+ eller \verb+tar cvf+
\item Some options require arguments, like \verb+tar -cf filename+ where \verb+-f+ needs a filename
\end{list2}



\slide{Manual System}

\hlkimage{7cm}{images/unix-command-1.pdf}

\begin{quote}
 It is a book about a Spanish guy called Manual. You should read it.
       -- Dilbert
\end{quote}

\begin{list1}
\item The Unix/Linux manual system is where you find the options, commands and file formats
\item Manuals must be installed, if not install them immediately
\item Very similar across Unix variants, OpenBSD is known for having an excellent manual pages
\item \verb+man -k+ allows keyword search similar can be done using \verb+apropos+
\end{list1}

Try \verb+man crontab+ and \verb+man 5 crontab+

NAME
     cal - displays a calendar
SYNOPSIS
     cal [-jy] [[month]  year]
DESCRIPTION
   cal displays a simple calendar.  If arguments are not specified, the cur-
   rent month is displayed.  The options are as follows:
   -j      Display julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January 1).
   -y      Display a calendar for the current year.

The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 on the 3rd
of September.  By this time, most countries had recognized the reforma-
tion (although a few did not recognize it until the early 1900's.)  Ten
days following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so the cal-
endar for that month is a bit unusual.
\end{alltt}

\slide{Unix Command Line Shells}


  \begin{list2}
    \item sh - Bourne Shell
\item bash - Bourne Again Shell, often the default in Linux
\item ksh - Korn shell, originally by David Korn, popular version \verb+pdksh+ public domain ksh
\item csh - C shell, syntax close to the C programming language
\item multiple others exist: zsh, tcsh
  \end{list2}
\begin{list1}
\item Comparable to command.com, cmd.exe and powershell in Windows
\item Also commonly used for small programs, scripts
\item When writing scripts use the characters number sign and exclamation mark (\verb+#!+) in the beginning
\end{list1}

.
\hlkrightpic{8cm}{0cm}{unix-vfs.pdf}
\begin{list2}

\item Unix/Linux uses a virtual filesystem\\
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem}
\item No drive letters, just disks mounted in a common tree
\item Everything starts with the file system root \verb+/+ - forward
\item An important directory is \verb+/etc/+ which includes a lot of configuration for the system and applications
\end{list2}

\slide{Definition}

\begin{quote}
  System integration is defined in engineering as the process of bringing together the component sub-systems into one system (an aggregation of subsystems cooperating so that the system is able to deliver the overarching functionality) and ensuring that the subsystems function together as a system,[1] and in information technology[2] as the process of linking together different computing systems and software applications physically or functionally,[3] to act as a coordinated whole.

  The system integrator integrates discrete systems utilizing a variety of techniques such as computer networking, enterprise application integration, business process management or manual programming.[4]
