Dear all,

During this time we will not be meeting face to face at Lygten, as announced by KEA. We will though try to follow the plan as usual:
https://zencurity.gitbook.io/kea-it-sikkerhed/system-integration/lektionsplan

and I have added more exercises than usual. So coming monday and next week I would like for you to do these things:
Read the chapters, as previously announced chapters 1-5 in the SOA book. note: There are a lot of figures in the chapters.

Download the newly uploaded/updated documents in the ressource folder here:
system-integration-exercises.pdf
6-SOA-EAI-ESB-system-integration.pdf
hand-in-assigments-kea-integration.pdf

Do the 5 exercises listed in the file 6-SOA-EAI-ESB-system-integration.pdf: Run PostgreSQL, Why go to SOA, Cloud Computing Introduction, Cloud Deployment
Download the Microservices ebook . I hope this provides flexibility and is possible in your current situation, kids, work, life etc.

I will announce Zoom meetings starting monday morning at 9, hoping you can find the time to join in and say hi. I will not be doing live teaching at this time, but you will be able to ask questions and get help for the exercises.

They will start monday
