\chapter*{\color{titlecolor}Preface}
\markboth{Preface}{}

This material is prepared for use in \emph{\kursus} and was prepared by
Henrik Kramselund, \url{http://www.zencurity.com} .
It describes the networking setup and
applications for trainings and courses where hands-on exercises are needed.

Further a presentation is used which is available as PDF from kramse@Github\\
Look for \jobname in the repo security-courses.

These exercises are expected to be performed in a training setting with network connected systems. The exercises use a number of tools which can be copied and reused after training. A lot is described about setting up your workstation in the repo

\url{https://github.com/kramse/kramse-labs}


\section*{\color{titlecolor}Prerequisites}

This material expect that participants have a working knowledge of
TCP/IP from a user perspective. Basic concepts such as web site addresses and email should be known as well as IP-addresses and common protocols like DHCP.

\chapter*{\color{titlecolor}Exercise content}
\markboth{Exercise content}{}

Most exercises follow the same procedure and has the following content:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Objective:} What is the exercise about, the objective
\item {\bf Purpose:} What is to be the expected outcome and goal of doing this exercise
\item {\bf Suggested method:} suggest a way to get started
\item {\bf Hints:} one or more hints and tips or even description how to
do the actual exercises
\item {\bf Solution:} one possible solution is specified
\item {\bf Discussion:} Further things to note about the exercises, things to remember and discuss
\end{itemize}

Please note that the method and contents are similar to real life scenarios and does not detail every step of doing the exercises. Entering commands directly from a book only teaches typing, while the exercises are designed to help you become able to learn and actually research solutions.


\chapter{\faExclamationTriangle\ Download Debian Administrator’s Handbook (DEB) Book 10 min}
\label{ex:sw-downloadDEB}

\hlkimage{3cm}{book-debian-administrators-handbook.jpg}


{\bf Objective:}\\
We need a Linux for running some tools during the course. I have chosen Debian Linux as this is open source, and the developers have released a whole book about running it.

This book is named
\emph{The Debian Administrator’s Handbook},  - shortened DEB

{\bf Purpose:}\\
We need to install Debian Linux in a few moments, so better have the instructions ready.

{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Create folders for educational materials. Go to download from the link \url{https://debian-handbook.info/}
Read and follow the instructions for downloading the book.

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have a directory structure for download for this course, and the book DEB in PDF you are done.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
Linux is free and everywhere. The tools we will run in this course are made for Unix, so they run great on Linux.

Debian Linux is a free operating system platform.

The book DEB is free, but you can buy/donate to Debian, and I recommend it.

Not curriculum but explains how to use Debian Linux

\chapter{\faExclamationTriangle\ Check your Debian Linux VM 10 min}
\label{ex:sw-basicDebianVM}

\hlkimage{10cm}{debian-xfce.png}

{\bf Objective:}\\
Make sure your virtual Debian server is in working order.

We need a Debian Linux for running a few extra tools during the course.

{\Large \bf This is a bonus exercise - only one Debian is needed per team.}

{\bf Purpose:}\\
If your VM is not installed and updated we will run into trouble later.

{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Go to \url{https://github.com/kramse/kramse-labs/}

Read the instructions for the setup of a Debian VM.

{\bf Hints:}\\

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have a updated virtualisation software and a running VM, then we are good.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
Linux is free and everywhere. The tools we will run in this course are made for Unix, so they run great on Linux.


\chapter{\faExclamationTriangle\ Investigate /etc 10 min}
\label{ex:sw-basicLinuxetc}


{\bf Objective:}\\
We will investigate the /etc directory on Linux. We need a Debian Linux and a Kali Linux, to compare

{\bf Purpose:}\\
Start seeing example configuration files, including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item User database \verb+/etc/passwd+ and \verb+/etc/group+
  \item The password database \verb+/etc/shadow+
\end{itemize}

{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Boot your Linux VMs, log in

Investigate permissions for the user database files \verb+passwd+ and \verb+shadow+

{\bf Hints:}\\
Linux has many tools for viewing files, the most efficient would be less.

\begin{alltt}
hlk@debian:~$ cd /etc
hlk@debian:/etc$ ls -l shadow passwd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2203 Mar 26 17:27 passwd
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1250 Mar 26 17:27 shadow
hlk@debian:/etc$ ls
... all files and directories shown, investigate more if you like
\end{alltt}

Showing a single file: \verb+less /etc/passwd+ and press q to quit

Showing multiple files: \verb+less /etc/*+ then :n for next and q for quit

\begin{alltt}
Trying reading the shadow file as your regular user:
user@debian-9-lab:/etc$ cat /etc/shadow
cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied
\end{alltt}

Why is that? Try switching to root, using su or sudo, and redo the command.

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have seen the most basic files you are done.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
Linux is free and everywhere. The tools we will run in this course are made for Unix, so they run great on Linux.

Sudo is a tool often used for allowing users to perform certain tasks as the super user. The tool is named from superuser do! \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo}


\chapter{\faInfoCircle\ Enable UFW firewall - 10 min}
\label{ex:debian-firewall}

{\bf Objective:}\\
Turn on a firewall and configure a few simple rules.

{\bf Purpose:}\\
See how easy it is to restrict incoming connections to a server.


{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Install a utility for firewall configuration.

You could also perform Nmap port scan with the firewall enabled and disabled.

{\bf Hints:}\\
Using the ufw package it is very easy to configure the firewall on Linux.

Install and configuration can be done using these commands.
\begin{alltt}
root@debian01:~# apt install ufw
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  ufw
0 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 164 kB of archives.
After this operation, 848 kB of additional disk space will be used.
Get:1 http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/debian stretch/main amd64 ufw all 0.35-4 [164 kB]
Fetched 164 kB in 2s (60.2 kB/s)
...
root@debian01:~# ufw allow 22/tcp
Rules updated
Rules updated (v6)
root@debian01:~# ufw enable
Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
root@debian01:~# ufw status numbered
Status: active

     To                         Action      From
     --                         ------      ----
[ 1] 22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 2] 22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
\end{alltt}

Also allow port 80/tcp and port 443/tcp - and install a web server. Recommend Nginx \verb+apt-get install nginx+

{\bf Solution:}\\
When firewall is enabled and you can still connect to Secure Shell (SSH) and web service, you are done.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
Further configuration would often require adding source prefixes which are allowed to connect to specific services. If this was a database server the database service should probably not be reachable from all of the Internet.

Web interfaces also exist, but are more suited for a centralized firewall.

Configuration of this firewall can be done using ansible, see the documentation and examples at \url{https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ufw_module.html}

Should you have both a centralized firewall in front of servers, and local firewall on each server? Discuss within your team.


\chapter{\faExclamationTriangle\ Git tutorials - 15min}
\label{ex:git-tutorial}


\hlkimage{3cm}{git-logo.png}

{\bf Objective:}\\
Try the program Git locally on your workstation

{\bf Purpose:}\\
Running Git will allow you to clone repositories from others easily. This is a great way to get new software packages, and share your own.

Git is the name of the tool, and Github is a popular site for hosting git repositories.

{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Run the program from your Linux VM. You can also clone from your Windows or Mac OS X computer. Multiple graphical front-end programs exist too.


First make sure your system is updated, as root run:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{shell}
sudo apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade && apt-get -y dist-upgrade
\end{minted}
You should reboot if the kernel is upgraded :-)

Second make sure your system has Git, ansible and my playbooks: (as root run, or with sudo as shown)
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{shell}
sudo apt -y install ansible git
\end{minted}


Most important are Git clone and pull:
\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
user@Projects:tt$ {\bf git clone https://github.com/kramse/kramse-labs.git}
Cloning into 'kramse-labs'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 283, done.
remote: Total 283 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 283
Receiving objects: 100% (283/283), 215.04 KiB | 898.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (145/145), done.

user@Projects:tt$ {\bf cd kramse-labs/}

user@Projects:kramse-labs$ {\bf ls}
LICENSE  README.md  core-net-lab  lab-network  suricatazeek  work-station
user@Projects:kramse-labs$ git pull
Already up to date.
\end{alltt}

We might use this repository for sharing files, in which case you would do a \verb+git pull+ to get the latest versions of files.

{\bf Hints:}\\
Browse the Git tutorials on \url{https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial}\\
and \url{https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/}

We will not do the whole tutorials within 15 minutes, but get an idea of the command line, and see examples. Refer back to these tutorials when needed or do them at home.

Note: you don't need an account on Github to download/clone repositories, but having an acccount allows you to save repositories yourself and is recommended.

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have tried the tool and seen the tutorials you are done.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
Before Git there has been a range of version control systems,\\
see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version\_control} for more details.



\chapter{\faInfoCircle\  Run small programs: Python, Shell script 20min}
\label{ex:small-python}

{\bf Objective:}\\
Be able to create small scripts using Python and Unix shell.

{\bf Purpose:}\\
Often it is needed to automate some task. Using scripting languages allows one to quickly automate.

Python is a very popular programming language. The Python language
is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.


You can read more about Python at:\\
\url{https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/} and \\
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)}

Shell scripting is another method for automating things on Unix. There are a number of built-in shell programs available.

You should aim at using basic shell scripts, to be used with \verb+/bin/sh+ - as this is the most portable Bourne shell.



{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Both shell and Python is often part of Linux installations.

Use and editor, leafpad, atom, VI/VIM, joe, EMACS, Nano ...

Create two files, I named them \verb+python-example.py+ and \verb+shell-example.sh+:

\VerbatimInput{python-example.py}

\VerbatimInput{shell-example.sh}

Unix does not require the file type .py or .sh, but it is often recommended to use it. To be able to run these programs you need to make them executable. Use the commands to set execute bit and run them:



Note: Python is available in two versions, version 2 and version 3. You should aim at running only version 3, as the older one is deprecated.

{\bf Hints:}\\
\begin{alltt}
$ chmod +x python-example.py shell-example.sh

$ ./python-example.py
21

$ ./shell-example.sh
Todays date in ISO format is: 2019-08-29
This system has 32 /etc/passwd users

\end{alltt}

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have tried making both a shell script and a python program, you are done.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
If you want to learn better shell scripting there is an older but very recommended book,

\emph{Classic Shell Scripting
Hidden Commands that Unlock the Power of Unix}
By Arnold Robbins, Nelson Beebe. Publisher: O'Reilly Media
Release Date: December 2008
 \url{http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596005955.do}

You can also decide to always use PowerShell for your scripting needs, your decision.


\chapter{\faExclamationTriangle\ Mitre ATT\&CK Framework 10 min}
\label{ex:mitre-attack}


\hlkimage{14cm}{mitre-attack.png}

Source:  Great resource for attack categorization



{\bf Objective:}\\
See examples of attack methods used by real actors.


{\bf Purpose:}\\
When analyzing incidents we often need to understand how they gained acccess, moved inside the network, what they did to escalate privileges and finally exfiltrate data.

{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Go to the web site \url{https://attack.mitre.org/}, browse the matrix and read a bit here and there.

Browse the ATT\&CK 101 Blog Post\\
\url{https://medium.com/mitre-attack/att-ck-101-17074d3bc62}


{\bf Hints:}\\
The columns can be thought of as a progression. An attacker might perform recon first, then gain initial access etc. all the way to the right most columns.

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have researched a few details in the model you are done.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
This is a large model which evolved over many years. You are not expected to remember it all, or understand it all.





\chapter{\faExclamationTriangle\ IP address research -- 30 min}
\label{ex:ip-address-research}

{\bf Objective:}\\
Work with IP addresses

{\bf Purpose:}\\
What is an IP address?

Investigate the following IP addresses
\begin{list2}
\item 192.168.1.1
\item 192.0.2.0/24
\item 172.25.0.1
\item 182.129.62.63
\item 185.129.62.63
\end{list2}

Write down everything you can about them!

{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Search for the addresses, look for web sites that may help.

{\bf Hints:}\\
Download the fun guide from Julia Evans (b0rk) \url{https://jvns.ca/networking-zine.pdf}

Pay attention to Notation Time page

Lookup \url{ripe.net} they may have a service called stats or stat -- something like that.

What is the Torproject? good, bad, neutral?

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have found some information about each of the above, say 2-3 facts about each you are done.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
IP addresses are much more than an integer used for addressing system interfaces and routing packets.

We will later talk more about \emph{IP reputation}


\chapter{\faExclamationTriangle\ Brim desktop app -  20 min}
\label{ex:brim-security}

\hlkimage {7cm}{brim-nitroba.png}

{\bf Objective:}\\
Try running Zeek through a desktop app. Zeek is an advanced open source network security monitoring tool that can decode network packets, either live or using packet capture files. \url{https://zeek.org/}

{\bf Purpose:}\\
You might be presented with a packet capture file, that must be analyzed. Brim is packaged as a desktop app, built with Electron just like many other applications. Once installed, you can open a pcap with Brim and it will transform the pcap into Zeek logs in the ZNG format.

{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Use either your normal operating system or the Debian VM. Then download the Brim desktop application from:
\url{https://www.brimdata.io/download/}

Download a sample packet capture:\\
\url{http://downloads.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/scenarios/2008-nitroba/nitroba.pcap}


{\bf Hints:}\\
Download the .deb file for your Debian and install using:
\verb+$ sudo dpkg -i brim_amd64.deb+

Then open a packet capture, nitroba.pcap is a common example used.

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have browsed the Brim web site you are done, better if you managed to run it.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
We often need a combination of tools, like Wireshark with GUI and Tcpdump with command line.

Here we have Brim with GUI and Zeek for command line and production use.

Use the tool you like best for the task at hand.



\chapter{\faInfoCircle\ Demo: Buffer Overflow 101 - 30-40min}
\label{ex:bufferoverflow}


{\bf Objective:}\\
Run a demo program with invalid input - too long.

{\bf Purpose:}\\
See how easy it is to cause an exception. For this course we also can see the Linux kernel will log information about this, and we could find this as an artifact later when investigating.

{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Instructor will walk through this!

{\Large
Mainly we are going to do something bad on a system, and hopefully the kernel and system will tell us something!

This exercise is meant to show how binary exploitation is done at a low level. If this is the first time you ever meet this, don't worry about it. You need to know this can happen, but you are not expected to be able to explain details during the exam!}

Running on a modern Linux has a lot of protection, making it hard to exploit. Using a Raspberry Pi instead makes it quite easy. Choose what you have available.

Using another processor architecture like MIPS or ARM creates other problems.

\begin{list2}
\item Small demo program \verb+demo.c+
\item Has built-in shell code, function \verb+the_shell+
\item Compile:
\verb+gcc -o demo demo.c+
\item Run program
\verb+./demo test+
\item Goal: Break and insert return address
\end{list2}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{c}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{      char buf[10];
        strcpy(buf, argv[1]);
        printf("%s\n",buf);
}
int the_shell()
{  system("/bin/dash");  }
\end{minted}

NOTE: this demo is using the dash shell, not bash - since bash drops privileges and won't work.

Use GDB to repeat the demo by the instructor.

{\bf Hints:}\\
First make sure it compiles:
\begin{alltt}
\$ gcc -o demo demo.c
\$ ./demo hejsa
hejsa
\end{alltt}

Make sure you have tools installed:
\begin{alltt}
apt-get install gdb
\end{alltt}

Then run with debugger:

\begin{alltt}
\$ gdb demo

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABC

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000434241414141 in ?? ()
(gdb)

\end{alltt}

Note how we can see the program trying to jump to address with our data. Next step would be to make sure the correct values end up on the stack.

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you can run the program with debugger as shown, you are done.

{\bf Discussion:}\\

the layout of the program - and the address of the \verb+the_shell+ function can be seen using the command \verb+nm+:

0000000000201040 D __TMC_END__
\end{alltt}

The bad news is that this function is at an address \verb+000000000000077c+ which is hard to input using our buffer overflow, please try \smiley We cannot write zeroes, since strcpy stop when reaching a null byte.

We can compile our program as 32-bit using this, and disable things like ASLR, stack protection also:
\begin{alltt}
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
sudo bash -c 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space'
gcc -m32 -o demo demo.c -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie
\end{alltt}

Then you can produce 32-bit executables:
\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
// Before:
user@debian-9-lab:~/demo$ file demo
demo: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=82d83384370554f0e3bf4ce5030f6e3a7a5ab5ba, not stripped
// After - 32-bit
user@debian-9-lab:~/demo$ gcc -m32 -o demo demo.c
user@debian-9-lab:~/demo$ file demo
demo: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=5fe7ef8d6fd820593bbf37f0eff14c30c0cbf174, not stripped
\end{alltt}

And layout:
\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
0804a024 B __bss_start
0804a024 b completed.6587
0804a01c D __data_start
0804a01c W data_start
...
080484c0 T the_shell
0804a024 D __TMC_END__
080484eb T __x86.get_pc_thunk.ax
080483a0 T __x86.get_pc_thunk.bx
\end{alltt}


Successful execution would look like this - from a Raspberry Pi:
\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
\$ gcc -o demo demo.c
\$ nm demo | grep the_shell
000104ec T the_shell
\$

...
(gdb) run `perl -e " print 'A'x16; print chr(0xec).chr(04).chr(0x01);" `
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
Starting program: /home/pi/demo/demo `perl -e " print 'A'x16; print chr(0xec) . chr(04)  . chr (0x01);" `
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

\chapter{\faExclamationTriangle\ Nginx logging  20 min}
\label{ex:nginx-logging}

{\bf Objective:}\\
See the common log format used by web servers.

\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format}


{\bf Purpose:}\\
Knowing that a common format exist, allow you to choose between multiple log processors.


{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Install and run Nginx on your Debian Linux VM and then check the logs.

\begin{alltt}
# apt install nginx
\end{alltt}

Run a browser, visit your server at http://127.0.0.1

\begin{alltt}
# cd /var/log/nginx
# ls
# less access.log
# less error.log
\end{alltt}

\faInfoCircle\
Produce some bad logs using the Nikto web scanner on Kali or using a browser, and check \verb+error.log+


{\bf Hints:}\\
A lot of scanning acctivities would result in error logs, so if you observe a rise in 404 not found or similar, then maybe you are being targetted.

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have tried the tool and seen some data you are done.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
I commonly recommend tools like Packetbeat and other tools from Elastic to process logs, see \url{https://www.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat}

Another popular one is Matomo formerly known as Piwik\\
\url{https://matomo.org/}.


\chapter{\faInfoCircle\  Packetbeat monitoring 15 min}
\label{ex:packetbeat}

\hlkimage{12cm}{packetbeat-mysql-performance.jpg}

{\bf Objective:}\\
Get introduced to a small generic monitoring system, Packetbeat from Elastic.


{\bf Purpose:}\\
Running packetbeat will allow you to analyse a few network protocols.

It can monitor multiple application protocols, namely DNS and MySQL may be of interest today.

It requires access to data at the network level, may be hard to do for cloud setups.

{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Read about Packetbeat at:\\
\url{https://www.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat}

{\bf Hints:}\\
This specific tool works with MySQL. Do a similar tool exist for other databases?


{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have gone through the list of protocols, and have a reasonable understanding of the available functions, you are done.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
What are your preferred monitoring systems?

Prometheus is getting quite popular.

\chapter{\faExclamationTriangle\ Nitroba Pcap -  45 min}
\label{ex:nitroba-pcap}

\hlkimage{3cm}{brim-nitroba.png}

{\bf Objective:}\\
We have been given a packet capture, what does it contain -- find interesting parts.

{\bf Purpose:}\\
You might be presented with a packet capture file, that must be analyzed.

{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Download a sample packet capture:\\
\url{http://downloads.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/scenarios/2008-nitroba/nitroba.pcap}

Use either your normal operating system or the Debian VM. Select tool(s) that can open such a file.


Example applications that may help:
\begin{list2}
\item Wireshark -- mostly manual work, but has all the details
\url{https://www.wireshark.org/}\\
The Debian package system has a version which not the latest, sometimes you should download from their site instead to get newest features.
\item Brim desktop application -- can do more automated decoding uses Zeek beneath\\
Try running Zeek through a desktop app, like we did in exercise \ref{ex:brim-security}
\item Run Zeek directly on the Pcap -- get Linux binaries from \url{https://zeek.org/get-zeek/}\\
If you checked out my repository \verb+kramse-labs+ it has Ansible playbooks in the directory \verb+suricatazeek+
\end{list2}


{\bf Hints:}\\
There is a back story to this packet capture, you can read it at:\\
\url{https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/scenarios/nitroba-university-harassment-scenario/}


Below are some extra exercises which help get you started with Zeek on the command line.
See exercise \ref{ex:zeekweb}, \ref{ex:zeekdnsbasic} and \ref{ex:zeekioc} These are NOT required for this course.

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have browsed the packet capture data you are done, better if you managed to find emails.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
We often need a combination of tools, like Wireshark with GUI and Zeek/Tcpdump with command line. Use the tool you like best for the task at hand.

The Nitroba pcap has been referenced many times over the years. The size is not too big, and exercises various features of tools -- so its a nice one to try out.




\chapter{\faInfoCircle\ Zeek on the web 10min}
\label{ex:zeekweb}


{\bf Objective:} \\
Try Zeek Network Security Monitor - without installing it.


{\bf Purpose:}\\
Show a couple of examples of Zeek scripting, the built-in language found in Zeek Network Security Monitor


{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Go to \url{http://try.zeek.org/#/?example=hello} and try a few of the examples.

{\bf Hints:}\\
The exercise
\emph{The Summary Statistics Framework} can be run with a specifc PCAP.

\verb+192.168.1.201 did 402 total and 2 unique DNS requests in the last 6 hours.+

{\bf Solution:}\\
You should read the example \emph{Raising a Notice}. Getting output for certain events may be interesting to you.


{\bf Discussion:}\\
Zeek Network Security Monitor is an old/mature tool, but can still be hard to get started using. I would suggest that you always start out using the packages available in your Ubuntu/Debian package repositories.  They work, and will give a first impression of Zeek. If you later want specific features not configured into the binary packages, then install from source.

The tool was renamed in 2018 from Bro to Zeek. Some commands and files still reference the old names.

Also Zeek uses a zeekctl program to start/stop the tool, and a few config files which we should look at. From a Debian system they can be found in \verb+/opt/zeek/etc+ :

This is from the Debian 11 package, checked May 2022

\verb+/opt/zeek/etc+:
\begin{alltt}
root@debian-lab-11:/opt/zeek/etc# ls -la
total 24
drwxrwsr-x  3 root zeek 4096 Apr 16 20:03 .
drwxr-xr-x 10 root root 4096 Apr 16 20:03 ..

\end{alltt}

\chapter{\faInfoCircle\ Zeek decode packets 10min}
\label{ex:zeekdnsbasic}


{\bf Objective:} \\
We will now start using Zeek on our systems.


{\bf Purpose:}\\
Try Zeek with example traffic, and see what happens.


{\bf Suggested method packet capture file:}\\
Use Nitroba.pcap can be found in various places around the internet

Note: a dollar sign is the Linux prompt, showing the command after
\begin{alltt}\small
$ cd
$ wget http://downloads.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/scenarios/2008-nitroba/nitroba.pcap
$ mkdir $HOME/zeek;cd $HOME/zeek; zeek -r ../nitroba.pcap
... Zeek reads the packets
~/zeek$ ls
conn.log  dns.log  dpd.log  files.log  http.log  packet_filter.log
sip.log  ssl.log  weird.log  x509.log
~/zeek$ less *
\end{alltt}

Use :n to jump to the next file in less, go through all of them. Use the \verb+zeek-cut+ program to select specific fields from the TSV files.

The logs formats can be changed into JSON, if you prefer see\\
\url{https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/log-formats.html}
\begin{alltt}\small
$ mkdir $HOME/zeek;cd $HOME/zeek; zeek -r ../nitroba.pcap LogAscii::use_json=T
\end{alltt}

{\bf Suggested method Live traffic:}\\
Make sure Zeek is configured as a standalone probe and configured for the right interface. Linux used to use eth0 as the first ethernet interface, but now can use others, like ens192 or enx00249b1b2991.

\begin{alltt}
root@debian-lab-11:/opt/zeek/etc# cat node.cfg
# Example ZeekControl node configuration.
#
# This example has a standalone node ready to go except for possibly changing
# the sniffing interface.

# This is a complete standalone configuration.  Most likely you will
# only need to change the interface.
[zeek]
type=standalone
host=localhost
interface=eth0
...
\end{alltt}

The interface may need to be configured differently for your installation!

{\bf Hints:}\\
There are multiple commands for showing the interfaces and IP addresses on Linux. The old way is using \verb+ifconfig -a+ newer systems would use \verb+ip a+

Note: if your system has a dedicated interface for capturing, you need to turn it on, make it available. This can be done manually using \verb+ifconfig eth0 up+
{\bf Solution:}\\
When you either run Zeek using a packet capture or using live traffic

Running with a capture can be done using a command line such as:
\verb+zeek -r traffic.pcap+

Using zeekctl to start it would be like this:
\begin{alltt}\small
// install Zeek files first
kunoichi:~ root# zeekctl
Hint: Run the zeekctl "deploy" command to get started.

Welcome to ZeekControl 1.5
Type "help" for help.

root@debian-lab-11:/opt/zeek/spool/zeek#
\end{alltt}

You should be able to spot entries like this in the file \verb+dns.log+:
\begin{alltt}\small
#fields ts      uid     id.orig_h       id.orig_p       id.resp_h       id.resp_p       proto   trans_id        rtt
     query   qclass  qclass_name     qtype   qtype_name      rcode   rcode_name      AA      TC      RD      RA      Z       answers TTLs    rejected
1538982372.416180	CD12Dc1SpQm42QW4G3	10.xxx.0.145	57476	10.x.y.141	53	udp	20383	0.045021	www.dr.dk	1	C_INTERNET	1	A	0	NOERROR	F	F	T	T	0	www.dr.dk-v1.edgekey.net,e16198.b.akamaiedge.net,2.17.212.93	60.000000,20409.000000,20.000000	F
\end{alltt}

Note: this show ALL the fields captured and dissected by Zeek, there is a nice utility program zeek-cut which can select specific fields:

\begin{alltt}\small
root@debian-lab-11:/opt/zeek/spool/zeek# cat dns.log | zeek-cut -d ts query answers | grep dr.dk
2018-10-08T09:06:12+0200	www.dr.dk	www.dr.dk-v1.edgekey.net,e16198.b.akamaiedge.net,2.17.212.93
\end{alltt}

{\bf Discussion:}\\
Why is DNS interesting?

If your Zeek installation is configured to use JSON, your output will be in JSON. What are the benefits of the original format, compared to JSON?



\chapter{\faInfoCircle\  Indicators of Compromise -- zeek intel module }
\label{ex:zeekioc}


{\bf Objective:} \\
Indicators of Compromise is a term used for artifacts observed in networks or systems which indicate that a system was compromised.

This could be a known DNS domain where a specifc malware is downloaded from, a specific file name downloaded, a TCP connection to a malware control and command server.

\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_of_compromise}

{\bf Purpose:}\\
The purpose of this exercise is to look at the data gathered and to start planning how one could use this with IOCs to perform after-the-fact analysis of your network.

Goal is to answer how an attack got in, when was the first device compromised etc.


{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Look at the data provided by Zeek, list the files again.

Which parts will be of greatest interest in your networks? Could some of these facts have helped prevent, restrict, limit or otherwise improve your security stance?


{\bf Hints:}\\
I think Suricata and Zeek has excellent value just by turning them on.


{\bf Solution:}\\
There is no one solution fits all, results are expected to vary from network to network.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
Zeek can include data from other sources, check the intel module\\
\url{https://www.zeek.org/sphinx/frameworks/intel.html}

and the exercise \url{https://www.zeek.org/current/exercises/intel/index.html}

Would this need to be updated every day to have value? How do we demonstrate return on investment and benefit from looking at traffic?






\chapter{\faExclamationTriangle\ Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228 IoCs 30 min}
\label{ex:log4shell-iocs}

\hlkimage{5cm}{log4j-logo.png}

{\bf Objective:}\\
Learn about IoCs by using a real life example Log4shell -- a Remote Code Execution vulnerability

{\bf Purpose:}\\
Finding IoCs are critical for incident response


{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Search for Log4Shell and Log4j -- what is this used for?

Then browse the main wikipedia page \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell}

and resources like \url{https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/apache-log4j-vulnerability}

Similar resource in Danish\\
 \url{https://www.cfcs.dk/globalassets/cfcs/dokumenter/2021/-tlp-white-bredt-varsel---kritisk-sarbarhed-i-apache-log4j-kodebibliotek-.pdf}

Then with basic knowledge search for lists of IP addresses scanning for this vulnerability.

Should eventually turn up references to sites like CrowdSec\\
\url{https://www.crowdsec.net/blog/detect-block-log4j-exploitation-attempts}

which references detailed information like:\\
\url{https://hub.crowdsec.net/author/crowdsecurity/configurations/apache_log4j2_cve-2021-44228}

and lists of IPs exploiting (trying to) this vulnerability:\\
\url{https://gist.github.com/blotus/f87ed46718bfdc634c9081110d243166}

{\bf Hints:}\\
Many tools can incorporate lists of IP addresses, to either block or detect.

{\bf Solution:}\\
When you have seen the CrowdSec detailed references you are done.

{\bf Discussion:}\\
How would you use this proactively to protect and how would you use this in incident response?
