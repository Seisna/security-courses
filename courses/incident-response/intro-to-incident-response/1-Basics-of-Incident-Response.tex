\hlkimage{2cm}{The_Cuckoos_Egg.jpg}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Threat intelligence was vital to intrusions over 20 years ago}, starting with the story told in {\bf the Cuckoo’s Egg, written by Cliff Stoll}, and has been ever since. But somehow, most organizations are {\bf still learning} to adopt the same principles. ... Lucky for us, this book now exists and steps the reader through {\bf proper threat-intelligence concepts, strategy, and capabilities} that an organization can adopt to evolve their security practice. After reading this book, your operations can grow to become an intelligence-driven operation that is much more efficient than ever in {\bf detecting and reducing the possible impact of breaches that will occur.}

\slide{Preface}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
The purpose of this book is to {\bf demonstrate how intelligence fits into the incident-response process}, helping responders understand their adversaries in order to {\bf reduce the time it takes to detect, respond to, and remediate intrusions.} Cyber threat intelligence and incident response have long been {\bf closely related}, and in fact are {\bf inextricably linked.} Not only does threat intelligence support and augment incident response, but incident response generates threat intelligence that can be utilized by incident responders. The goal of this book is to help readers {\bf understand, implement, and benefit} from this relationship.

{\large\bf Intelligence as Part of Incident Response}\\
As long as there has been conflict, there have been those who studied, analyzed, and
strove to understand the enemy. Wars have been won and lost based on an ability to
understand the way the enemy thinks and operates, to comprehend their motivations
and identify their tactics ...

\slide{What do we mean by Intelligence}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Intelligence is often defined as information that has been refined and analyzed to
make it actionable. Intelligence, therefore, requires information. In intelligence-
driven incident response, there are multiple ways to gather information that will be
analyzed and used to support incident response.

\slide{Chapter 2: Basics of Intelligence}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
“Joint Publication 2-0,” the US military’s primary joint intelligence doctrine, is one of
the foundational intelligence documents used today. In its introduction, it states,
“Information on its own may be of utility to the commander, but when related to
other information about the operational environment and considered in the light of
past experience, it gives rise to a new understanding of the information, which may
be termed intelligence.”
\end{quote}
Source: \emph{Intelligence-Driven Incident Response} (IDIR)\\
 Scott Roberts. Rebekah Brown, ISBN: 9781491934944

\begin{list2}
\item \emph{Data} is a piece of information, a fact, or a statistic. Data is something that describes something that \emph{is}.
\item \emph{Intelligence} is {\bf derived from a process} of collecting, processing, and analyzing data. Once it has been analyzed, it must be disseminated in order to be useful.
\end{list2}

\slide{Indicators of Compromise }

\begin{quote}
There was a time when many people considered indicators of compromise, or IOCs,
to be synonymous with threat intelligence. IOCs, which we will reference a lot and
cover in depth later in the book, are {\bf things to look for} on a system or in {\bf network logs} that may {\bf indicate that a compromise has taken place}. This includes IP addresses and domains associated with command-and-control servers or malware downloads, hashes of malicious files, and other network- or host-based artifacts that may indicate an intrusion.
\end{quote}
Source: \emph{Intelligence-Driven Incident Response} (IDIR)\\
 Scott Roberts. Rebekah Brown, ISBN: 9781491934944



\slide{Indicators of Compromise and Signatures}

\begin{quote}
An IOC is any piece of information that can be used to objectively describe a
network intrusion, expressed in a platform-independent manner. This could include a simple indicator such as the IP address of a command and control (C2) ser
ver or a complex set of behaviors that indicate that a mail server is being used as a malicious SMTP relay.

When an IOC is taken and used in a platform-specific language or format, such as a Snort Rule or a Zeek-formatted file, it becomes part of a signature. A signature can contain one or more IOCs.

\slide{Intelligence Cycle or Intelligence Process}

\hlkimage{9cm}{The_Intelligence_Process_JP_2-0.png}

\begin{list2}
\item I decided to take the more original Intelligence Process picture, which has a bit more details
\end{list2}

\slide{Processing}

Let's look at some processing

\begin{list2}
\item Processing includes normalizing collected data into uniform formats for analysis
\item Indexing -- Large volumes of data need to be made searchable
\item Translation -- for our course we might get multiple input formats but need JSON or XML
\item Enrichment -- Providing additional metadata for a piece of information is important. For example, domain addresses need to be resolved to IP addresses, and {\bf WHOIS registration data fetched}
\item Filtering --
Not all data provides equal value, and analysts can be overwhelmed when presen‐
ted with endless streams of irrelevant data
\item Prioritization --
The data that has been collected may need to be ranked so that analysts can allo‐
cate resources to the most important items\\
Note: this relates to a \emph{baseline}, what errors are normal in your environment
\item Visualization -- Data visualization has advanced significantly and the human eye and brain can often see patterns
\end{list2}

\slide{Chapter 3: Basics of Incident Response}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Incident response encompasses the entire process of {\bf identifying intrusions} (whether against a single system or an entire network), developing the information necessary to {\bf fully understand them}, and then {\bf developing and executing the plans} to {\bf remove the intruders}.
\end{quote}
Source: \emph{Intelligence-Driven Incident Response} (IDIR)\\
 Scott Roberts. Rebekah Brown, ISBN: 9781491934944


\begin{list2}
\item An important part of this is \emph{when} to activate the incident response team, what qualifies? Triage of incidents
\end{list2}

\slide{Preparation}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
For a defender, the first stage of an incident comes before the attack begins: the Preparation phase. Preparation is the defender’s chance to get ahead of the attacker by deploying new detection systems, creating and updating signatures, and understanding baseline system and network activity.
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Telemetry -- You can’t find what you can’t see
\item Hardening -- The only thing better than identifying an intrusion quickly is it never happening in the first place
\item Process and documentation -- On the nontechnical side, process is the first line of defense that can be prepared ahead of time\\
You may see the term Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) used in literature
\item Practice -- The last thing preparation allows is the chance to practice your plans. This will speed up future incidents and identify issues that can be corrected
\end{list2}

\slide{Identification}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
The Identification phase is the moment where the defender identifies the presence of
an attacker impacting their environment. This can occur though a variety of methods:
\begin{list2}
\item Identifying the attacker entering the network, such as a server attack or an
incoming phishing email
\item  Noticing command-and-control traffic from a compromised host
\item  Seeing the massive traffic spike when the attacker begins exfiltrating data
\item  Getting a visit from a special agent at your local FBI field office
\item  And last, but all too often, showing up in an article by Brian Krebs
\end{list2}
\end{quote}

\slide{Containment}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Common containment options are as follows:
\begin{list2}
\item Disabling the network switch port to which a particular system is connected
\item  Blocking access to malicious network resources such as IPs (at the firewall) and domains or specific URLs (via a network proxy)
\item  Temporarily locking a user account under the control of an intruder
\item  Disabling system services or software an adversary is exploiting
\end{list2}
\end{quote}

\slide{Eradication}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Eradication consists of the longer-term mitigation efforts meant to keep an attacker
out for good (unlike the temporary measures in the Containment phase). These
actions should be well thought out and may take a considerable amount of time and
resources to deploy. They are focused on completely obviating as many parts of the
adversary’s plan from ever working in the future.

Common eradication actions are as follows:
\begin{list2}
\item Removing all malware and tools installed by the adversary (see the sidebar “Wiping and Reloading Versus Removal” on page 32)
\item Resetting and remediating all impacted user and service accounts
\item Re-creating secrets that could have been accessed by the attacker, such as shared passwords, certificates, and tokens
\end{list2}
\end{quote}

\slide{Recovery}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Containment and eradication often require {\bf drastic action}. Recovery is the process of going back to a nonincident state. In some regards, recovery is less from the attack itself, but more from the actions taken by the incident responders.

For example, if a compromised system is taken from a user for forensic analysis, the
Recovery phase involves returning or replacing the user’s system so that user can
return to previous tasks. If an entire network is compromised, the Recovery phase
involves undoing any actions taken by the attacker across the entire network, and can
be a {\bf lengthy and involved process.}
\end{quote}

\end{list2}

\slide{Lessons Learned -- Follow-Up}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
Ultimately, the key to Lessons Learned is having the understanding that although early lessons learned will be painful, they will improve—and that’s the point. Early Lessons Learned exercises will call out {\bf flaws, missing technology, missing team members, bad processes, and bad assumptions}. Growing pains with this process are common, but take the time and gut through them. {\bf Few things} will improve an IR team and IR capability as {\bf quickly} as some {\bf tough lessons learned}.
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Goal is to mature your team, methods, procedures, identification, ...
\item More efficient is cheaper, faster, better
