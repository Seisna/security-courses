\slide{Time schedule -- wednesday March 30.}

This day we will be doing a larger project, get started planning incident response
\begin{list2}
\item 1) Going over a few cases from Denmark -- first 45min
\item 2) Plan your incident response, the mission -- 45 min
\item Break 15min
\item 3) Plan your incident response, tools -- 45min
\item 4) Plan your incident response, processes 45min
\end{list2}

Times are suggested, in real life this process would take months!

\slide{Part 1: Go over a few more cases}

%\hlkimage{}{}

Let's go over some of the recent cases from Denmark

You are most likely to find jobs in Denmark, and we know danish companies better

\slide{Example cases and Categories from Denmark}

Start by finding a few cases from Denmark, we already talked about Maersk but feel free to re-use this data.

Cases I know are: Forsvaret (2023), Demant (2019), Ecco (2022), kommuner, infrastruktur

Try to put them in categories and find examples of each category:
\begin{list2}
\item DDoS
\item Data leaks -- check datatilsynets perhaps
\item Ransomware Demant -- ransomware, but may stealing data too?
\item ... more categories here, maybe use Mitre ATT\&CK for inspiration
\end{list2}

Response
\begin{list2}
\item What did they do, consider advice from book
\item Could they have responded differently
\item What were they missing, could they learn from this
\item What are some things we definitely would have \emph{ready} for handling incidents
\item What did it cost them, input for security budgets
\end{list2}


\slide{Part 2-4) Plan your incident response}

\begin{quote}
Congratulations -- you are now the CISO

And we would like to A) Avoid incidents B) Resolve any incident efficiently
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Rest of today we will plan our incident response in Company XYX
\end{list2}

\slide{Company XYX}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}
This medium sized company with 100 employees produce a cheese cutter and sell them all over the world. They are the number one brand of cheese cutters, loved by chefs around the world.
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Turnover is in the millions
\item Orders are flowing in through a web shop for customers
\item Another web shop is used by B2B segment for ordering 1.000s of cheese cutters
\end{list2}

Help them, they don't have a CISO, they don't have security people, they are afraid of security incidents -- but don't know anything about them


\slide{Your Goal }

%\hlkimage{}{}

There will be a management and board meeting soon, and you will present

\begin{list2}
\item The XYX Security Organisation
\item The XYX security org mission statement
\item The Basic XYX Incident Response Process
\item The contact list for incident handling, feel free to add external companies
\item A list of systems and tools to put in place before incidents (CMDB?)
\item A list of programs, applications, tools, hardware to use for incidents (external drives and go-bag?)
\end{list2}

\slide{Further inspiration}

%\hlkimage{}{}

We have our main book, and have links to other documents, so feel free to find inspiration in:

\begin{list2}
\item NIST documents SP800 series
\item Awesome lists, like: \url{https://github.com/meirwah/awesome-incident-response}
\end{list2}
