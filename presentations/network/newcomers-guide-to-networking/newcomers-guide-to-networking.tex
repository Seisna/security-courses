% Abstract
% The Newcomers' Guide to Networking: Textbooks for the Next GenerationÃ—
% How can we attract more newcomers to our networking communities? I work in education, and I learnt about networking the old school way in the 1990s, with large 500 page textbooks, and this is still sometimes the case. Can we crowdsource interesting and useful sources of knowledge for the next generation? Can we create a "newcomers' guide to networking"?

\slide{Problem statement}

{\Large Your co-worker has a question: \emph{You work in networking}, so can you give me some pointers for my friend that wants to \emph{get into networking}?!}

\item A small call for resources, send me your best links, resources, books, papers, and interesting resources\\
I will add them here $====>$ \url{https://github.com/kramse/learning-paths}
\item May contain opnionated content, beware
\item BTW \emph{my slides are boring!}

\begin{list2}
\item Thank you to all the authors of the books I have learnt from. Thank you all that wrote RFCs, I enjoy them a lot
\item Unfortunately they are not beginner friendly, if I was a newcomer today I would probably NOT read them
\item Many resources are very structured, but become a bit boring, sorry
\end{list2}

\slide{Prerequisite knowledge}

\hlkimage{6cm}{nmap-logo.png}
{\Large Plan: You want to learn Port Scanning and Nmap! \\
Usefull in both defense and attack scenarios!}

\begin{list2}
\item Knowledge level: What is a port scanner\\
Need to know TCP/IP, IP address, ports and services -- example HTTP 80/tcp, TCP session setup
\end{list2}

So a newcomer should get this sorted out first, otherwise they cannot understand what Nmap does, and output returned

\slide{Skills are needed}

\hlkimage{9cm}{nmap-zenmap.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Skills level: Running a port scanner\\
Need to have operating system -- luckily Nmap supports Mac, Windows, Linux, ...
\item My recommendation: create a virtual machine with Kali Linux\\
BTW ... what is a Virtual Machine?! And so it keeps on
\end{list2}


\slide{Small set of Recommended networking technologies to learn}

So to accomplish the goal of using Nmap efficiently you need some basics

Networking: Basic Protocols from the Internet Protocols suite IP/TCP, or TCP/IP
\begin{list2}
\item Network Layer: Ethernet, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), IPv4 and ICMP\\
Later add Wi-Fi and IPv6
\item Transport Layer: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
\item Common upper layer: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain Name System (DNS),
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\\
Later add the encrypted/secure versions like Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) which uses Transport Layer Security (TLS)
\end{list2}

Enough to be able to go to other resources, and a connected path from ARP to TLS


\slide{What am I looking for -- easier entry ways into networking}

\slide{Send me your best resources for newcomers}

\begin{list2}
\item Send your best links and resource to me \verb+hlk@kramse.org+
\item I will collect it and probably make an \emph{awesome list} -- there are awesome lists for just about any topic on Github
\item Github repo added \url{https://github.com/kramse/learning-paths} -- pull requests welcome
\end{list2}

I am also very happy to discuss learning with you in breaks, I am here until friday.
