%  Talk Proposal: Sikkerhed på et stramt budget
% Vi ser manglende ressourcer overalt, også indenfor IT-faget. Det betyder at organisationer mangler tid, penge, og personer til at udføre arbejdet.

% I dette foredrag ser vi - overordnet - på sikkerhed i Danmark 2024.

% Hvordan skal vi håndtere sikkerheden når vi ikke kan nå det hele?

% Eksempler på indhold:
% * Hvad sker der uden sikkerhed? Hvad er risikoen?
% * Hvilke systemer skal prioriteres?
% * Kan automatisering hjælpe?
% * Hvor kan automatisering ikke hjælpe?
% * Hvem kan man ringe til? Hvem skal man ringe til? Hvornår?

% Placering: Foredraget foregår i Prosa's egne lokaler i Odense, hvor der vil blive serveret en sandwich og en øl/vand i løbet af aftenen.

% Målgruppe: Alle der er interesserede i IT-sikkerhed på højere niveau i organisationer.

% Nøgleord: Ressourceknaphed, it-governance, automatisering, optimering

\slide{Core Concepts}

Information Security is a huge domain:

\begin{quote}
The (ISC)² CBK is a collection of topics relevant to cybersecurity professionals around the world. It establishes a common framework of information security terms and principles which enables cybersecurity and IT/ICT professionals worldwide to discuss, debate and resolve matters pertaining to the profession with a common understanding, taxonomy and lexicon.
\end{quote}
Source: \link{https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CBK}

List of 8 domains in CISSP CBK: Security and Risk Management, Asset Security,
Security Architecture and Engineering, Communications and Network Security, Identity and Access Management, Security Assessment and Testing, Security Operations, Software Development Security

\slide{Books and courses}

%\hlkimage{}{}

How:

I like to learn new concepts from books
\begin{list2}
\item Have a clear structure, less confusion
\item They go from a basic level towards a complete goal
\item Often have exercises available with nice progression
\item Lots of nice books available from \link{http://www.nostarch.com/} and others
\item Often you can get Humble bundles with many books for \$25
\item Some books are "free" if you give your email address, example\\
\emph{Web Application Security}, Andrew Hoffman, 2020, ISBN: 9781492053118 - download for free through Nginx:\\
\link{https://www.nginx.com/resources/library/web-application-security/}
\end{list2}

Pro Tip: all my courses and exercise booklets are available on Github!

Humble Bundle!




\slide{Other Materials}


Pro tip: ENISA, the european agency publishes nice materials, including course materials:\\

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Information comes in many formats, resources, programs, people, authors, documents, sites
that further your exploration into network and security

\item I force my students to read older hacker texts files, computer science papers, web articles, books chapters, standard documents, internet request for comments (RFCs)

\item Goal is to kickstart their journey into the subjects

\item Also serves to mention organizations, groups, persons, authors that I recommend you follow and read from
\end{list2}

\slide{Recommended tools to learn}

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Open Source I really love open source. There is just too much great open source software, to ignore, and security budgets are tight in DK!
\item Linux/Unix knowledge is necessary
-- because a lot of the newest tools are written for Linux/Unix/BSD
\item Git and Github -- where you can find lots of tools, libraries, applications
\item Programming experience is an advantage for automating stuff -- Python is a nice generic tool for this
\item Ansible provisioning -- installing and configuring software for production
\item Elasticsearch -- how to run a \emph{service}, full fledged applications exist for Elasticsearch
\end{list2}

{\bf I consider Linux/Unix knowledge a must for working in Networking and Security}


\slide{Tools: Open Source and Python}
\hlkimage{7cm}{maltrail.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Open Source is already written *doh*
\item Can provide solutions or parts of a solution
\item Often feature-rich, mature, tested, maintained, and even when \emph{not} can be brought back to life
\item Picture from Maltrail \link{https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail}\\
Maltrail is a malicious traffic detection system, utilizing publicly available (black)lists containing malicious and/or generally suspicious trails, along with static trails compiled from various AV reports and custom user defined lists,

\slide{Equipment -- wanna work with networks}

Laptops, one is enough to get started

.
\hlkrightpic{85mm}{-2cm}{sample-network.png}

\begin{list1}
\item I have a network with me when needed, \\
which has the following systems:
\begin{list2}
\item OpenBSD router
\item Switches Juniper EX2200-C and small TP-Link
\item UniFi AP wireless access-point
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

Above or similar can often be found lying around in offices, ask if you can take it.


\slide{Wifi Hardware}

I recommend getting an extra wireless network card for your laptop.

A wireless USB network card with external antenna can be used for many purposes.

\begin{list2}
\item The following are two recommended models:
\item TP-link TL-WN722N hardware version 2.0 cheap but only support 2.4GHz
\item Alfa AWUS036ACH 2.4GHz + 5GHz Dual-Band and high performing
\item Both usually work great in Kali Linux
\item Newer, better, cheaper may exist -- YMMV
\end{list2}

I have some available for people to try if you dont want to buy them.

And if you have the money, USB Ethernet for playing with raw frames in your VM\\
I use 200DKK StarTech USB Ethernet -- works for me


\slide{Hacker lab setup -- tips}

\hlkimage{8cm}{hacklab-1.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Hardware: any modern laptop with CPU and virtualisation\\
Don't forget to enable it in the BIOS
\item Software: your favourite operating system Windows, Mac, Linux, ...
\item Virtualisation software: VMware, Virtual box, pick your poison
\item Hacker software: Kali as a Virtual Machine \link{https://www.kali.org/}
