%  Talk Proposal: Sikkerhed på et stramt budget
% Vi ser manglende ressourcer overalt, også indenfor IT-faget. Det betyder at organisationer mangler tid, penge, og personer til at udføre arbejdet.

% I dette foredrag ser vi - overordnet - på sikkerhed i Danmark 2024.

% Hvordan skal vi håndtere sikkerheden når vi ikke kan nå det hele?

% Eksempler på indhold:
% * Hvad sker der uden sikkerhed? Hvad er risikoen?
% * Hvilke systemer skal prioriteres?
% * Kan automatisering hjælpe?
% * Hvor kan automatisering ikke hjælpe?
% * Hvem kan man ringe til? Hvem skal man ringe til? Hvornår?

% Placering: Foredraget foregår i Prosa's egne lokaler i Odense, hvor der vil blive serveret en sandwich og en øl/vand i løbet af aftenen.

% Målgruppe: Alle der er interesserede i IT-sikkerhed på højere niveau i organisationer.

% Nøgleord: Ressourceknaphed, it-governance, automatisering, optimering

\begin{quote}
- For året 2019 rapporterede vi et tab i omsætning på {\bf 575 millioner kroner}. Det i sig selv er alvorligt. Hvad angår vores opmærksomhed på it-sikkerhedsområdet, har it-hændelsen været med til at understrege nødvendigheden af, at tage dette felt seriøst. Angreb mod it-infrastruktur er uden tvivl en af de største trusler mod en virksomhed, og det kan gå galt, hvis man ikke er i stand til at lukke ned for skaden og bruge sin back-up.

...

- På det konkrete plan har vi fået et mantra der lyder {\bf ’Active Directory is king, and backup is Queen’}. Men mere overordnet har vi også lært at Fokus skal helt op på øverste niveau i virksomheden, at man skal skaffe høj faglig indsigt i sikkerhed og trusler, og at det er et arbejde, der skal være under konstant observation og udvikling.

\begin{list2}
\item Open Source I really love open source. There is just too much great open source software, to ignore
\item Linux/Unix knowledge is necessary
-- because a lot of the newest tools are written for Linux/Unix/BSD
\item Git and Github -- where you can find lots of tools, libraries, applications
\item Programming experience is an advantage for automating stuff\\
Python is a nice generic tool for this, PowerShell is another alternative
\item Ansible provisioning -- installing and configuring software for production
\item Elasticsearch -- how to run a \emph{service}, full fledged applications exist for Elasticsearch
\item OpenSSH -- included in Linux and Windows, allows for Rsync, Git, port forward etc.
