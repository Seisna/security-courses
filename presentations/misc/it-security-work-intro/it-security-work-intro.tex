\slide{Core Concepts}

Information Security is a huge domain:

\begin{quote}
The (ISC)² CBK is a collection of topics relevant to cybersecurity professionals around the world. It establishes a common framework of information security terms and principles which enables cybersecurity and IT/ICT professionals worldwide to discuss, debate and resolve matters pertaining to the profession with a common understanding, taxonomy and lexicon.
\end{quote}
Source: \link{https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CBK}

List of 8 domains in CISSP CBK: Security and Risk Management, Asset Security,
Security Architecture and Engineering, Communications and Network Security, Identity and Access Management, Security Assessment and Testing, Security Operations, Software Development Security

- then add all the news about new tools, exploits, and networking



\slide{Hacker tools}

\begin{list1}
\item \emph{Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking Into it}\\ by
Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema in 1993
\item Later in 1995 released the software SATAN\\
\emph{Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks}
\item Caused some commotion, panic and discussions, every script kiddie can hack, the internet will melt down!
\vskip 5mm
\begin{quote}
We realize that SATAN is a two-edged sword -- like
many tools, it can be used for good and for evil
purposes. We also realize that intruders (including
wannabees) have much more capable (read intrusive)
tools than offered with SATAN.

\slide{Learning at different levels}

\hlkimage{10cm}{trinity-nmapscreen-hd-cropscale-418x250.jpg}

To illustrate this, I will use the example of:\\
Nmap - a very famous port scanner.

Unfortunately there are about 100 options, and the man page is some 3100 lines ...

\slide{Prerequisite knowledge}

Plan: You want to learn Nmap!

{\large Often we combine our knowledge with skills into competence, \\
which enable us to perform some job, task or function.}

\begin{list2}
\item Knowledge level: What is a port scanner\\
Need to know TCP/IP, IP address, ports and services -- example HTTP 80/tcp, TCP session setup
\end{list2}

So get this sorted out first, otherwise you cannot understand what Nmap does, and output returned

\slide{Skills are needed}

\hlkimage{9cm}{nmap-zenmap.png}


\begin{list2}
\item Skills level: Running a port scanner\\
Need to have operating system -- luckily Nmap supports Mac, Windows, Linux, ...
\item My recommendation: create a virtual machine with Kali Linux
\end{list2}

\slide{Combined it becomes a Competence}

\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
full-tcp-scan: nmap -p 1-65535 -A -oA full-tcp-scan -iL targets
dns-scan: nmap -sU -p 53 --script=dns-recursion -iL targets -oA dns-recursive
bgpscan: nmap -A -p 179 -oA bgpscan -iL \$LINKNET
dns-recursive: nmap -sU -p 53 --script=dns-recursion -iL targets -oA dns-recursive
php-scan: nmap -sV --script=http-php-version -p80,443 -oA php-scan -iL targets
scan-vtep-tcp: nmap -A -p 1-65535 -oA scan-vtep-tcp 192.0.2.77 192.0.2.78
snmp-10.x.y.0.gnmap: nmap -sV -A -p 161 -sU --script=snmp-info -oA snmp-10xy 10.x.y.0/19
snmpscan: nmap -sU -p 161 -oA snmpscan --script=snmp-interfaces -iL targets
sshscan: nmap -A -p 22 -oA sshscan -iL targets
vncscan: nmap -A -p 5900-5905 -oA vncscan -iL targets
\end{alltt}

\begin{list2}
\item Competence level: Running a quality port scan of an enterprise\\
Need to have plan for scanning, know which scan functions to use
\end{list2}

My recommendation: work through a 4 hour course with Nmap as the subject


\slide{OSI Model and Internet Protocols}

\hlkimage{10cm,angle=90}{images/compare-osi-ip.pdf}

\slide{Recommended technologies to learn}


So to accomplish the goal of using Nmap efficiently you need some basics

Networking: Basic Protocols from the Internet Protocols suite IP/TCP, or TCP/IP
\begin{list2}
\item Network Layer: Ethernet, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), IPv4 and ICMP\\
Later add Wi-Fi and IPv6
\item Transport Layer: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
\item Common upper layer: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain Name System (DNS),
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\\
Later add the encrypted/secure versions like Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) which uses Transport Layer Security (TLS)
\end{list2}

Pro tip: always say Ethernet frames and IP packets. No one uses datagram anymore.

Pro tip: If you \emph{really know DNS} you can make a huge impact in the malware area!


\slide{Recommended tools to learn}

\begin{list2}
\item Open Source I really love open source. There is just too much great open source software, to ignore, and security budgets are tight in DK!
\item Linux/Unix knowledge is necessary
-- because a lot of the newest tools are written for Linux/Unix/BSD
\item Git and Github -- where you can find lots of tools, libraries, applications
\item Programming experience is an advantage for automating stuff -- Python is a nice generic tool for this
\item Ansible provisioning -- installing and configuring software for production
\item Elasticsearch -- how to run a \emph{service}, full fledged applications exist for Elasticsearch
\end{list2}


\slide{Nice Rack you got there!}

\hlkimage{8cm}{rackskab.jpg}

\slide{Physical Inspection is Needed}

Yes, go through the server room!

Things we find:
\begin{list2}
\item Single firewall, running with a single power supply -- single point of failure
\item No Uninterruptable Power Supply -- having NO UPS is bad if availability is important
\item Bad cabling, disaster can strike, and no one can help you
\item Bad cooling can take down your whole company
\end{list2}

Advice: Start documenting your setup -- buy a label maker today

\slide{Core Switch Administration}

Then I also found switch administration with admin/admin *sigh*

\hlkimage{10cm}{edgemax-admin-admin.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Is this the main switch for the whole office?! Yes - unfortunately
\item I was also called up one time about a large core switch that had lost configuration, nothing worked
\end{list2}


\slide{Cisco ACI (2019)}

{\bf I consider Linux/Unix knowledge a must for working in Networking and Security}


\slide{Tools: Open Source and Python}
\hlkimage{7cm}{maltrail.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Open Source is already written *doh*
\item Can provide solutions or parts of a solution
\item Often feature-rich, mature, tested, maintained, and even when \emph{not} can be brought back to life
\item Picture from Maltrail \link{https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail}\\
Maltrail is a malicious traffic detection system, utilizing publicly available (black)lists containing malicious and/or generally suspicious trails, along with static trails compiled from various AV reports and custom user defined lists,
\end{list2}

It-anvendelse i virksomheder (tema) 2022 It-sikkerhed i mikrovirksomheder}

Dokumentation og dermed delbar viden om it-sikkerhedstiltag og -regler er et væsentlig element i virksomhedernes arbejde med digital sikkerhed. {\bf Over halvdelen af Danmarks godt 14.000 mikrovirksomheder (5-9 ansatte) havde i 2022 ingen dokumentation} om forholdsregler, aktiviteter og procedurer vedr. it-sikkerhed. Der var således 53 pct. af virksomhederne med 5-9 ansatte, der ikke havde dokumenteret deres it-sikkerhedstiltag, mv. Til sammenligning var den tilsvarende andel 45 pct. blandt virksomheder med minimum 10 ansatte og blot 8 pct. blandt de største virksomheder med minimum 250 ansatte.

\begin{list2}
\item We need more resources, a lot more!
\end{list2}


\slide{Hackers don't give a shit}

Your system is only for testing, development, ...

Your network is a research network, under construction, \\
being phased out, ...

Try something new, go to your management

Bring all the exceptions, all of them, update the risk \\
analysis figures - if this happens it is about 1mill DKK

Ask for permission to go full monty on your security

{\bf Think like attackers - don't hold back}

\slide{Wifi Hardware}

I recommend getting an extra wireless network card for your laptop.

A wireless USB network card with external antenna can be used for many purposes.

\begin{list2}
\item The following are two recommended models:
\item TP-link TL-WN722N hardware version 2.0 cheap but only support 2.4GHz

\item Both usually work great in Kali Linux
\item Newer, better, cheaper may exist -- YMMV
\end{list2}

I have some available for people to try if you dont want to buy them.

And if you have the money, USB Ethernet for playing with raw frames in your VM\\
I use 200DKK StarTech USB Ethernet -- works for me
