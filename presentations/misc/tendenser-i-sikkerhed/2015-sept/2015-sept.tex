Previously thought to be impossible thanks to the slow pace and high stress it puts on a computer's CPU, the CynoSure Prime group managed to crack over 11 million passwords from the total of 36 million, mainly due to a programming error in how the passwords were hashed.

\begin{quote}
	Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world. ~A Cypherpunk's Manifesto by Eric Hughes, 1993

\slide{Overview of malware bypass today}

Quote:
The primary malware installation, sometimes referred as an infection, can be achieved using several attack vectors.
The goal is always to run malicious code. Some of the most common attack vectors are:

\begin{list2}
\item 1. Browser-based social engineering: where a user is tricked into clicking on a legitimate-looking URL which in turn triggers code execution using browser or browser-plugin vulnerabilities in Java and Flash. More advanced attacks can hide in legitimate traffic without requiring any user-interaction. These are commonly referred to as drive-by downloads.
\item 2. Email-based social engineering and spear phishing: where a user receives an email that contains a hidden or visible binary, which executes when the user clicks on it.
\item 3. Credential theft: when guessed or stolen credentials are used to access a remote machine and execute (malicious) code, such as installing a backdoor.
\end{list2}

\slide{Overview of malware bypass today, continued}

Evasion techniques
To evade detection, during and after installation, malware uses five primary techniques.
\begin{list1}
\item 1. Wrapping. This process attaches the malicious payload (the installer or the malware itself) to a legitimate file.
... IceFog is a well-known malware commonly wrapped with a legitimate-looking CleanMyMac application and used to target OS X users. On the Windows platform, OnionDuke has been used with legitimate Adobe installers shared over Tor networks to infect machines.
\item 2. Obfuscation. This involves modifying high level or binary code it in a way that does not affect its functionality, but completely changes its binary signature. ... Malware authors have adopted the technique to bypass antivirus engines and impair manual security research. ...
\end{list1}

\slide{Overview of malware bypass today, continued}

\begin{list1}
\item 3. Packers. These software tools are used to compress and encode binary files, which is another form of obfuscation.... These techniques are extremely effective at circumventing static signature engines.
\item 4. Anti-debugging. Like obfuscation, anti-bugging was originally created by software developers to protect commercial code from reverse-engineering. Anti-debugging can prevent a binary from being analyzed in an emulated environments such as virtual machines, security sandbox, and others. ...
\item 5.  Targeting. This technique is implemented when malware is designed to attack a specific type of system (e.g. Windows XP SP 3), application (e.g. Internet Explorer 10) and/or configuration (e.g. detecting a machine not running VMWare tools, which is often a telltale sign for usage of virtualization). ...

\slide{DNSSEC get started now}

\hlkimage{14cm}{cz-nic-dnssec-tlsa-validator.png}

\begin{quote}
"TLSA records store hashes of remote server TLS/SSL certificates. The authenticity of a TLS/SSL certificate for a domain name is verified by DANE protocol (RFC 6698). DNSSEC and TLSA validation results are displayer by using several icons."
\end{quote}


\slide{DNSSEC and DANE}

\begin{quote}
"Objective:

Specify mechanisms and techniques that allow Internet applications to
establish cryptographically secured communications by using information
distributed through DNSSEC for discovering and authenticating public
keys which are associated with a service located at a domain name."
\end{quote}

DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (dane)

Old news - we have been talking about DANE for years!
\link{https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dane/charter/}\\
{\footnotesize \link{http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.dk/2011/04/improving-ssl-certificate-security.html}}

Trend, we have HUGE populations of older servers, systems, people,
that are just not taking to new technologies - even if it would solve a lot of problems

Case in point: IPv6

\slide{But DNSSEC is bad! DNS Amplification?!}

Yes, DNSSEC has larger responses, used for amplification DDoS attacks.

\begin{quote}
"This is the official homepage for PacketQ, a simple tool to make SQL-queries against PCAP-files, making packet analysis and building statistics simple and quick. PacketQ was previously known as DNS2db but was renamed in 2011 when it was rebuilt and could handle protocols other than DNS among other things.

Look how easy it's to count DNS-packets in a PCAP-file."

\slide{February 2015: Finding infected sources}

\begin{quote}
"We were contacted by a client to help with their incident response in tracking down an
infection on a clients machine with the new CTB-Locker ransomware (Curve-Tor-Bitcoin Locker)
aka Critroni which had no signatures available at the time of infection for this variant.

LANGuardian includes a file share activity monitoring module which provided a very
detailed forensic analysis of the ransomware and the paths it had taken in order to
encrypt the clients system and also the fileserver in which it was connected to, the
initial infection came from the opening of an attachment in an e-mail."

\begin{quote}\small
"A group of cryptographers at INRIA, Microsoft Research and IMDEA have discovered some serious vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (e.g., Android) clients and Apple TLS/SSL clients (e.g., Safari) that allow a 'man in the middle attacker' to downgrade connections from 'strong' RSA to 'export-grade' RSA. These attacks are real and exploitable against a shocking number of websites -- including government websites. Patch soon and be careful."

\slide{Feb 2015 Today I Am Releasing Ten Million Passwords}

\begin{quote}
"  Why the FBI Shouldn't Arrest Me\\
  Although researchers typically only release passwords, I am releasing usernames with the passwords. Analysis of usernames with passwords is an area that has been greatly neglected and can provide as much insight as studying passwords alone. Most researchers are afraid to publish usernames and passwords together because combined they become an authentication feature. If simply linking to already released authentication features in a private IRC channel was considered trafficking, surely the FBI would consider releasing the actual data to the public a crime."
