% Email Security - domains, clients and servers

% This presentation will be focused on email security overall - from domains to clients to servers. The presentation will include a lot of acronyms and some technical details, the goal though is to get an overview of available technologies and their benefits.

% We will talk about domains and the current internet standards and recommendations for setting DNS records and features to optimise the reception of email securely - using encryption and certificates. Also which DNS records and features will prevent your domains from being abused for sending fake emails such as phishing with you as the sender.

% We will discuss client features which are considered dangerous, loading images automatically etc. and how to improve your client security by using only specific protocols with encryption.

% Servers will be discussed as examples of email architectures. Common blueprints for email will be discussed including which components are to be used for getting insights into your email security - reporting functions. Example open source software will be shown.

% The goal for this presentation is for participants to get an overview of current email security, to allow them to evaluate their own posture - and plan a strategy to improve email security, both personally and professionally.

% Keywords: SMTP, TLS, DNS MX, DNS TXT, DMARC, SPF, DKIM, SMTP DANE - RFC 7672, MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS), SMTP TLS Reporting, OpenARC, DMARC reporting, Postfix, Dovecot, Lets Encrypt certificates and Open Source mail tools

% Note: This presentation will not cover much filtering of anti-virus, phishing and malware except recommend having incoming and outgoing proxy servers where such services can be provided.

% Slides will be in english, but presentation language danish.

\slide{Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)}

\begin{quote}
  The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. As an Internet standard, SMTP was first defined in 1982 by RFC 821, and updated in 2008 by RFC 5321 to Extended SMTP additions, which is the protocol variety in widespread use today. Mail servers and other message transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages.

\slide{Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)}

\begin{quote}
In computing, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection.[1] IMAP is defined by RFC 3501.

IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. An IMAP server typically listens on port number 143. IMAP over SSL (IMAPS) is assigned the port number 993.

Virtually all modern e-mail clients and servers support IMAP, which along with the earlier POP3 (Post Office Protocol) are the two most prevalent standard protocols for email retrieval.[2] Many webmail service providers such as Gmail, Outlook.com and Yahoo! Mail also provide support for both IMAP and POP3.

We will talk about domains and the current internet standards and recommendations for setting DNS records and features to optimise the reception of email securely - using encryption and certificates. Also which DNS records and features will prevent your domains from being abused for sending fake emails such as phishing with you as the sender.

Servers will be discussed as examples of email architectures. Common blueprints for email will be discussed including which components are to be used for getting insights into your email security - reporting functions. Example open source software will be shown.


\slide{Email Software}

My recommendations are:
\begin{list2}
\item Sending mail with SMTP using Postfix
\item Receiving mail with IMAP using Dovecot
\end{list2}

I would NOT use these:
\begin{list2}
\item Exim - multiple Remote Code Execution in 2019, fatal security vulns \\
\url{https://www.exim.org/static/doc/security/}
\item OpenSMTPD has had some really strange vulnerabilities recently\\

Dovecot is an open-source IMAP and POP3 server for Unix-like operating systems, written primarily with security in mind.[3] Timo Sirainen originated Dovecot and first released it in July 2002. Dovecot developers primarily aim to produce a lightweight, fast and easy-to-set-up open-source email server.

The primary purpose of Dovecot is to act as mail storage server. Mail is delivered to the server using some mail delivery agent (MDA) and stored for later access with an email client (mail user agent, or MUA).

\item Gennem DHCP får man typisk også information om DNS servere
\item En DNS server kan slå navne, domæner og adresser op
\item Foregår via query og response med datatyper kaldet resource records
\item DNS er en distribueret database, så opslag kan resultere i flere opslag
\end{list1}


\slide{DNS more than just web site name lookup}

% DNS MX, DNS TXT

\begin{list1}
  \item DNS is based on resource records of types:
    \begin{list2}
\item A-record is an address
\item Quad-A AAAA-records are IP version 6 addresses
\item Authoritative name servers are listed in NS-records
\item Email exchangers are put into MX-records
\item Multiple others: md ,  mf ,  cname ,  soa ,
                  mb , mg ,  mr ,  null ,  wks ,  ptr ,
                  hinfo ,  minfo ,  mx ....
\item Previously there was SRV server records and types being added, but today a lot of functionality is put into TXT records -- a text string with information
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

\begin{alltt}
ns1     IN      A       185.129.60.130
        IN      AAAA    2a06:d380:0:3065::53
www     IN      A       185.129.60.130
        IN      AAAA    2a06:d380:0:3065::80
\end{alltt}

\slide{DNS Example}


\begin{alltt}
user@Projects:images$ host -t ns zencurity.com
zencurity.com name server ns1.gratisdns.dk.
zencurity.com name server ns2.gratisdns.dk.
zencurity.com name server ns3.gratisdns.dk.
zencurity.com name server ns4.gratisdns.dk.
zencurity.com name server ns5.gratisdns.dk.
user@Projects:images$ host -t mx zencurity.com
zencurity.com mail is handled by 10 mail.kramse.org.
\end{alltt}

So this domain is found at the GratisDNS system and uses a single mail server record.

By default all of this happens without encryption and no integrity protection!

Note: I use mostly \verb+host+ while DNS admins typically use \verb+dig+

The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by the Domain Name System (DNS) as used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It is a set of extensions to DNS which provide to DNS clients (resolvers) cryptographic authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality.

\item Use them all
\end{list2}

A huge part of email security is ensuring our domains are not abused in spoofing attacks, and spam



\slide{Sender Policy Framework (SPF)}

\begin{alltt}
 $ host -t TXT zencurity.com
 zencurity.com descriptive text "v=spf1 a mx mx:kramse.dk -all"
\end{alltt}

\begin{quote}\footnotesize
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication method designed to detect forging sender addresses during the delivery of the email.[1] SPF alone, though, is limited only to detect a forged sender claimed in the envelope of the email which is used when the mail gets bounced.[1] {\bf Only in combination with DMARC can it be used to detect the forging of the visible sender in emails} (email spoofing[2]), a technique often used in phishing and email spam.

SPF allows the receiving mail server to check during mail delivery that a mail claiming to come from a specific domain is submitted by an IP address authorized by that domain's administrators.[3] The list of authorized sending hosts and IP addresses for a domain is published in the DNS records for that domain.
\end{quote}

Source:\\{\footnotesize
\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework}}


\slide{DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)}

\begin{quote}
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows the receiver to check that an email claimed to have come from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the owner of that domain.[1] It achieves this by affixing a digital signature, linked to a domain name, to each outgoing email message. The recipient system can verify this by looking up the sender's public key published in the DNS. A valid signature also guarantees that some parts of the email (possibly including attachments) have not been modified since the signature was affixed.[2] Usually, DKIM signatures are not visible to end-users, and are affixed or verified by the infrastructure rather than the message's authors and recipients.
\end{quote}

\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail}}

\slide{Domain-based Message Authentication (DMARC)}

\begin{quote}\footnotesize
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) is an email authentication protocol. It is designed to give email domain owners the ability to protect their domain from unauthorized use, commonly known as email spoofing. The purpose and primary outcome of implementing DMARC is to protect a domain from being used in business email compromise attacks, phishing emails, email scams and other cyber threat activities.

Once the DMARC DNS entry is published, any receiving email server can authenticate the incoming email based on the instructions published by the domain owner within the DNS entry. If the email passes the authentication it will be delivered and can be trusted. If the email fails the check, depending on the instructions held within the DMARC record the email could be delivered, quarantined or rejected.

DMARC extends two existing mechanisms, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM).

\slide{DMARC for non-sending Domains}
If you have domains that \emph{never send email} then add the following SPF and DMARC to avoid misuse.

from my own DSN template for \emph{parked domains}:
\begin{alltt}
gdns.template   v=spf1 -all     43200
_dmarc.gdns.template    v=DMARC1; p=reject;     43200
\end{alltt}




\slide{Get Started and Get Resources}

{\bf Suggested method:}\\
Use services on the internet, such as \link{https://internet.nl/} and \link{https://dmarcian.com/} to see current status for your domains.

{\bf Hints:}\\
I suggest the following strategy when you implement these methods, if you dare do it right now. If you make a plan.

{\bf Basic mail security}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement DNSSEC - turn it on, most likely easy
\item Configure Sender Policy Framework, perhaps only \verb+~all+ tilde means soft fail
\item Configure DomainKeys Identified Mail
\item Configure receiving email address for DMARC
\item Configure Domain-based Message Authentication - reject none
\end{enumerate}


{\bf Advanced mail security}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create real certificates for TLS and DANE, I use Lets Encrypt
\item Publish them \smiley
\end{enumerate}

Take domain(s) of your choice and make a table:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline
Domain \faEnvelopeO & DNS NS 2+ & DNSSEC & SPF & DKIM & DMARC & DANE \\\hline
zencurity.com & \faCheck & \faCheck & \faCheck &  & \faCheck & \\ \hline

 &  &  &  & & & \\\hline
 &  &  &  & & & \\\hline
\end{tabularx}

{\bf Discussion:}\\
You need to research before making changes to important domains.

Spend some time trying different tools for DMARC reporting. A month or a week, depending on the domain and your users. Github alone has 100s of projects concerned with parsing, reporting and working with DMARC.

Then after some time has passed, and you have reviewed reporting from DMARC, turn it on for real:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Configure SPF to disallow with hard fail use \verb+-all+ minus
\item Configure DMARC with reject - reject emails not following policy
\end{enumerate}


\begin{list2}
\item Before implementing security, monitor your services
\item DMARC Analysis and reporting tools
\item SMTP TLS Reporting
\end{list2}


\slide{Next steps}

Future mail standards - young and not widely used:
\begin{list2}
\item MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)\\
\url{https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8461.txt}
\item SMTP TLS Reporting\\
\url{https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8460}
\item OpenARC The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) Protocol, JULY 2019 RFC 8617\\
\url{https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8617}
\end{list2}

\slide{Checking for new standards}

\begin{quote}
Update (23 April 2019): Gmail has become the first major email provider to support MTA-STS and TLSRPT, making it easier to justify deploying these new standards. More information is available in their blog post.

Update (26 Sep 2018): MTA-STS has been officially published as RFC 8461.

MTA-STS (full name SMTP Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security) is a new standard that aims to improve the security of SMTP by enabling domain names to opt into strict transport layer security mode that requires authentication (valid public certificates) and encryption (TLS). In this blog post we discuss why MTA-STS exists and how it's used, as well as announce full support for its most recent draft in Hardenize.
