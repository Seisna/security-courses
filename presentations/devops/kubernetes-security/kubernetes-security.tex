% Kubernetes Security

% Vi ser på Kubernetes med sikkerhedsbrillerne på.

% Kubernetes er blevet en af de mest populære cloud teknologier både til self-hosted og hos cloud leverandører. Vi vil i dette foredrag se på infrastrukturen i cloud med Kubernetes som eksempel. Det er emner som netværksovervågning, stresstest, muligheder for beskyttelse og isolering samt forensic og opklaring af hændelser.

% Deltagerne vil efterfølgende kunne opsætte miljø tilsvarende underviserens og træne sikkerhed i et lukket miljø.

% Fokus vil være på best current practice med rigeligt med referencer til dokumenter og teknisk know-how, hvordan det kan gøres hos jer selv i praksis bagefter.

% Målgruppe: alle der er interesserede i overvågning af cloud, men primært Kubernetes.

% Varighed: 4 timer inkl pauser

% Nøgleord:
% Cloud security, DDoS protection, load balancing, logs and audit, cloud monitoring, performance testing

% Dato: Mandag 6. februar kl. 17.00-21.00
% Sted: Online. Direkte link bliver sendt pr. mail på dagen.
% Pris: Gratis for medlemmer af PROSA. 525 kr. for ikke-medlemmer

\slide{My Intentions}

\hlkimage{7cm}{thomas-drouault-IBUcu_9vXJc-unsplash.jpg}

I suspect you want to work with Kubernetes, maybe you already do, but:
\begin{list2}
\item You are responsible for all of it
\item You don't have the resources, knowledge, time, etc. for getting to know it all
\item You have to create an architecture, as well as implement it
\item ... and monitor it, ... and secure it
\end{list2}
My intention is to be your sparring partner today, list all the parts I think must be considered.

\slide{Target Audience}

\hlkimage{9cm}{nesa-by-makers-IgUR1iX0mqM-unsplash.jpg}

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Overall target audience: operators, and developers becoming operators -- devops
\item Maybe secdevops - security personnel that needs some scalable systems running on K8s
    - like myself
\item People being told to setup a K8s cluster -- for some app
\end{list2}


\slide{Disclaimer: I am not an expert in EVERYTHING Kubernetes}

\begin{quote}
\large \bf I am not an EXPERT \\
-- but I have read a lot and watched youtube videos. \smiley
\end{quote}

\begin{list1}
\item Kubernetes is such a big ecosystem
\item The list is long, and an incomplete list contains:
\begin{list2}
\item Kubernetes core components -- software written by the project RBAC etc.
\item Kubernetes supported container technologies, docker etc.
\item Kubernetes dependencies -- etcd software used for storing data
\item Operating systems -- and that lies below, storage
\item Kubernetes networking providers -- multiple exist, which one to choose -- like Cilium
\item Monitoring solutions -- logging solutions
\end{list2}
\item and on top all the applications in and around Kubernetes -- NGINX, PostgreSQL, ...
\end{list1}

\slide{Why are we here today then?!}
\hlkrightimage{10cm}{eugen-str-CrhsIRY3JWY-unsplash.jpg}

We are here to get an overview:
\begin{list2}
\item Identify what we \emph{need} for a Kubernetes production environment
\item Consider more parts of the picture than \emph{just Kubernetes core}
\item Find a solution that works, with some example technologies
\item Provide a kind of check list for your deployment
\end{list2}

\vskip 5mm
\begin{center}
In general I want to take a more holistic approach to\\
Kubernetes Security which I hope can help you
\end{center}


\slide{More Disclaimers}

\begin{list2}
\item Disclaimer: We cover security today\\
We will not cover all parts of K8s  - only the ones that we need for security, as few as possible.\\
This slideshow is not a replacement for the official docs, and we also recommend multiple\\ resources books, articles and papers detailing specific parts

\item Disclaimer: Deprecation\\
Things are built, and later deprecated. Even while preparing this a few things were deprecated! Core things even change from time to time, which is good. In general I don't trust older references, but verify with newest official docs

\item Disclaimer: Single tenant only\\
Running a K8s cluster for your organization is hard enough, I don't claim I could run a production multi-tenancy setup or public cloud YMMV
\end{list2}

\slide{Materials -- where to start}

\begin{list2}
\item This presentation -- slides for today, start here
\item \emph{Kubernetes: Up and Running}, 3rd Edition, Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower,
August 2022\\
Introduces containers and Kubernetes, books in 3rd ed also has been fixed and updated
\item \emph{Container Security}, (CS) Liz Rice, O'Reilly, Apr 2020\\
A classic text about containers and a must read for everyone
\item \emph{Networking and Kubernetes: A Layered Approach}, James Strong, Vallery Lancey, O'Reilly, 2021\\
K8s uses a lot of intricate networking -- great for understanding this more
\item \emph{Learn Kubernetes Security} (LKS), Kaizhe Huang , Pranjal Jumde, Packt, July 2020\\
This is a very complete and detailed view at K8s security, covering many many parts
\item Advanced security practioners could perhaps enjoy security focused books like:\\

\end{list2}

\slide{Creating a lab is not expensive}

\hlkrightimage{8cm}{internet-in-a-box.jpeg}

I use ordinary IT-equipment like switches, PCs and servers, with some additional 10Gbps network devices -- nothing really special running Debian Linux

The main purposes for showing this box, is to show
\begin{list2}
\item These are standard network devices, bought the Arista 7150 24-port 10G used on ebay
\item This specific switch does VXLAN VTEP and BGP, which I use in my labs
\item OpenBSD which I use for routing also has built-in VXLAN and BGP
\end{list2}

You should have similar (or better) devices in your production network, and they can be
configured to do a LOT more than you use them for right now


\slide{Before your first K8s Production Deployment}

%\hlkimage{}{}


\begin{list2}
\item Run K8s locally, as in your laptop!
\item Get it up and running, deploy a sample container
\item Configure \faWrench\ \verb+kubectl+
\end{list2}

I don't remember when I ran K8s first, or how many times I have run it locally or in various example labs on the internet. Recently I ran some K8s BGP labs in my browser

Trying out K8s on your laptop:

\begin{list2}
\item Smallest demo with single node minikube running inside Debian 11
    "start and run a hello world"
\item Next one might be multiple VMs running K8s nodes -- multi node with OpenBSD VM for BGP
\item I can run all of this inside Qubes as HVM
\end{list2}


\slide{Main K8s Components}

\begin{list2}
\item Interfaces API
\item Ports and Services
\end{list2}



\slide{K8s objects}
\begin{list2}
\item like Service accounts
\end{list2}


\slide{From low level outside}

Starting from the bottom and upwards - keeping it short on purpose:
\begin{list2}
\item Hardware - DRAC, ILO, KVM, IPMI etc.
\item Connections - how to connect your clusters\\
- find some blueprints, add management network, show complete drawing!
\item Have some jump host, OpenBSD with wireguard VPN, show it works - *demo*
\item Consider access from the outside and inwards
\end{list2}

Now you have built a cluster -- great, is it secure? Does it even work, can you run it?


\slide{Document or it didn't happen}

\hlkimage{8cm}{mythical-man-month-documentary.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Make sure to document!
\item There are so many parts, so many decisions, soo many places thing can mess up
\item Have a minimum of documentation -- and the YAML files are not enough
\item Hint:  you can read the Mythical Man Month at \link{https://archive.org/details/MythicalManMonth}

\slide{Role-based Access Control (RBAC)}

\begin{quote}
In computer systems security, {\bf role-based access control (RBAC)}[1][2] or role-based security[3] is an approach to restricting system access to unauthorized users. It is used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees,[4] and can implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around {\bf roles and privileges}. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments. A study by NIST has demonstrated that RBAC addresses many needs of commercial and government organizations[citation needed]. RBAC can be used to facilitate administration of security in large organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions. Although RBAC is different from MAC and DAC access control frameworks, it can enforce these policies without any complication.

\slide{New to RBAC?}

To get an idea about roles, permissions within software projects, you can use Github as an example.

\begin{list2}
\item
Go to GitHub web page:\\
\link{https://help.github.com/en/articles/access-permissions-on-github}
\item Follow links to other pages, like:\\
\link{https://help.github.com/en/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization}
\item Your K8s deployment might need more than this, but it is a nice starting point
\end{list2}

\end{list2}

\slide{Recommended Users}

\begin{list2}
\item
\end{list2}
What to create, how many people, how large a group do you have?

Smallest:
Create admin group even if only one admin! Ref RIPE database roles

Medium:
Start out with a large group of all admins
Split into a few groups, maybe some overlap
Don't give all users all authorizations

\slide{Soft Multitenancy}

\begin{list2}
\item
\end{list2}
as described in HK chapter 7 p 177
easier than hard multitenancy

Goal prevent some avoidable accidents and problems, breaking other groups services, but easier to maintain


\slide{A note about service accounts}

Rule: always specify a K8s Network Policy - be specific, who CAN access
make positive lists - as normally only a limited number of other resources will need access
- then also make sure to specify an egress policy
So both ingress and egress rules

\begin{quote}
  Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) is a global initiative, supported by the Internet Society, that provides crucial fixes to reduce the most common routing threats. ﻿
\end{quote}
Source: {\small\link{https://www.manrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MANRS_PDF_Sep2016.pdf}}

\begin{list2}
\item Problems related to incorrect routing information
\item Problems related to traffic with spoofed source IP addresses -- can easily happen in K8s
\item Problems related to coordination and collaboration between network operators
\item Also BCP38 RFC2827 \emph{Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks
which employ IP Source Address Spoofing}
\end{list2}

You should all ask your internet providers if they know about MANRS, and follow it. We should ask our government and institutions to support and follow MANRS and good practices for network on the Internet
