\slide{Hacker -- cracker}

{\bfseries Short answer -- dont discuss this}

%Det lidt længere svar:\\
Yes, originally there was another meaning to hacker, but the media has perverted it and today, and since early 1990s it has meant breaking into stuff for the public

{\color{red}\hlkbig Today a hacker breaks into systems!}

Reference. Spafford, Cheswick, Garfinkel, Stoll, \ldots
- wrote about this and it was lost

Story is interesting and the old meaning is ALSO used in smaller communities, like hacker spaces full of hackers - doing fun and interesting stuff

 Espionage},  Clifford Stoll

\slide{Hacker tools}

\begin{quote}
We realize that SATAN is a two-edged sword -- like
many tools, it can be used for good and for evil
purposes. We also realize that intruders (including
wannabees) have much more capable (read intrusive)
tools than offered with SATAN.
\end{quote}
Source:
\link{http://www.fish2.com/security/admin-guide-to-cracking.html}

\begin{list2}
\item I got into hacking due to the security papers from Spaff and others, like this:
\emph{Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking Into it}, Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema, 1993
\item Later in 1995 released the software SATAN\\
\emph{Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks}
\item Caused some commotion, panic and discussions, every script kiddie can hack, the Internet will melt down!
\end{list2}



\slide{Use hacker tools!}

\begin{list2}
\item Port scan can reveal holes in your defense
\item Web testing tools can crawl through your site and find problems
\item Pentesting is a verification and proactively finding problems
\item Its not a silverbullet and mostly find known problems in existing systems
\item Combined with honeypots they may allow better security
\end{list2}



\slide{Agreements for testing networks}

\begin{quote}\small
Danish Criminal Code\\
Straffelovens paragraf 263 Stk. 2. Med bøde eller fængsel indtil 1 år og 6 måneder straffes den, der uberettiget skaffer sig adgang til en andens oplysninger eller programmer, der er bestemt til at bruges i et informationssystem.
\end{quote}

Hacking can result in:
\begin{list2}
\item Getting your devices confiscated by the police
\item Paying damages to persons or businesses
\item If older getting a fine and a record -- even jail perhaps
\item Getting a criminal record, making it hard to travel to some countries and working in security
\item Fear of terror has increased the focus -- so dont step over bounds!
\end{list2}

Asking for permission and getting an OK before doing invasive tests, always!


\slide{Why even do security testing?}

\begin{list1}
\item Lots of security problems
\item Pentesting may be a requirement from external partners -- example VISA PCI standard
\end{list1}

\begin{list2}
\item Boss asking: should we do a security test?
\item CIO: hmm, okay
\item IT Admins: *sigh* -- I know the security sucks in places!
\item Its not your systems -- dont take the criticism personal, but as an opportunity to get things improved
\vskip 1cm
\item Pentest tools are great resources for doing discovery of assets, evaluating the security of large installations quickly -- in short using pentest tools makes you more efficient!
\end{list2}

\centerline{\Large Many see the benefits after doing a pentest, so try it!}


\slide{Benefits of having a planned security test done}

\begin{quote}
Goal of testing is to reduce risk for the systems and secure the organisation\\ from unexpected loss of data, image and increased costs.
\end{quote}

\begin{list1}
\item Intended audience:
\begin{list2}
\item IT-department and technical personnel
\item Management and board
\item External auditors, government, financial control VISA/PCI, the public
\end{list2}
\item Output from testing:
\begin{list2}
\item Reports with technical content and recommendations
\item Executive summary
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

Goal is not to find a scape goat to blame -- management allocates resources

If security is below in places more resources may be needed.


\slide{Planning a pentest}


\begin{list2}
\item Scope -- what is being tested
\item When is the testing done -- time frame, wall clock time
\item Where are the attacks coming from -- log files will contain the attacks\\
but other attacks from other sources are likely during the attacks, which must be blocked
\item We sometimes go broader than the scope -- perhaps checking the router in front with SNMP or doing a small port 80/tcp scan
\item Agree if Denial of Service is to be tested
\item TL;DR Rules of engagement for the project
\end{list2}


\slide{Selecting systems for testing}

\hlkimage{9cm}{overview-routing-customer-2015.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Routers on the way to critical systems and networks -- especially availability
\item Firewall -- is the environment protected sufficiently, discarding probes
\item Mail servers -- relay testing and also critical data
\item Web servers -- holds data, typically has a lot of functionality
\item Cloud systems, storage systems, anywhere data is saved
\end{list2}


\slide{Testing Agreement and Scope Example}

\begin{list1}
\item Usually the scope could include targets like these:
\begin{list2}
\item 192.168.1.1 -- firewall/router
\item 192.168.1.2 -- mail server
\item 192.168.1.3 -- web server
\item Test to be done from monday 1st until friday 5th
\item Testing done from 192.0.2.0/28
\end{list2}
\item When testing web servers and sites, especially API -- please include hostname, URLs, documentation. If not included some sites and functionality will NOT be tested!
\end{list1}


\slide{Reporting -- results}

\begin{list1}
\item What is in a pentest report:
\begin{list2}
\item Title, Table of contents, formal report thanks
\item Confidentiality agreement – Write ”Confidential” on each page
\item Executive summary – big companies always want this
\item Information about the scan done, what was it
\item Scope and targets
\item Review of all targets – detailed information and recommendations
\item Conclusion – may be more technical
\item Appendices – various information, Whois info about subnets and prefixes
\end{list2}
\item BTW When delivering a report, it is up to the organisation to decide which recommendations to implement
\end{list1}

Sample report available at: \link{https://github.com/kramse/pentest-report}

\slide{Rules of engagement -- rules and ethics for security testing}

\begin{list2}
\item NB: big difference between Denmark and other places!
\item Security consultant must not be the cause of new vulnerabilities due to the testing
\item Security consultant must not install new software on systems without previous agreement
\item Security consultant is not to leave insecure system administrator accounts or settings after testing
\item Security consultant always contact the customer in case of high-risk vulnerabilities
\item It is allowed to peek around in the network -- checking if there might be an insecure development or testing server near by
\item If you meet other security problems outside of the scope we still report them, but perhaps in an appendix
\end{list2}

\centerline{In general be careful of other people networks and systems}




\slide{Hacker tools}

\slide{OSI Model and Internet Protocols}

\hlkimage{10cm,angle=90}{images/compare-osi-ip.pdf}


\slide{Recommended technologies to learn}


So to accomplish the goal of using Nmap efficiently you need some basics

Networking: Basic Protocols from the Internet Protocols suite IP/TCP, or TCP/IP
\begin{list2}
\item Network Layer: Ethernet, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), IPv4 and ICMP\\
Later add Wi-Fi and IPv6
\item Transport Layer: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
\item Common upper layer: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain Name System (DNS),
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\\
Later add the encrypted/secure versions like Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) which uses Transport Layer Security (TLS)
\end{list2}

Pro tip: always say Ethernet frames and IP packets. No one uses datagram anymore.

Pro tip: If you \emph{really know DNS} you can make a huge impact in the malware area!

\slide{What happens now?}

\begin{list1}
\item Think like a hacker
\item Reconnaissance
\begin{list2}
\item ping sweep, port scan
\item OS detection -- TCP/IP or banner grabbing
\item Service scan -- rpcinfo, netbios, ...
\item telnet/netcat interact with services
\end{list2}
\item Exploit/test: Metasploit, Nikto, exploit programs
\item Cleanup/hardening not shown today, but:
\begin{list2}
\item Make a report or document findings
\item Change, improve and harden systems
\item Go through report with stakeholders, track progress
\item Update programs, settings, configurations, architecture
\end{list2}
\item You also need to show others that you are in control of security
\end{list1}


\slide{Hacker lab setup}

\hlkimage{8cm}{hacklab-1.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Hardware: any modern laptop with CPU and virtualisation\\
Don't forget to enable it in the BIOS
\item Software: your favourite operating system Windows, Mac, Linux, ...
\item Virtualisation software: VMware, Virtual box, pick your poison
\item Hacker software: Kali as a Virtual Machine \link{https://www.kali.org/}
\item Soft targets: Metasploitable, Linux, Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Exchange, Windows server, ...
\end{list2}

\slide{Kali Linux the pentest toolbox}

\hlkimage{14cm}{kali-linux.png}

\begin{list1}
\item  Kali \link{http://www.kali.org/}
\item 100.000s of videos on youtube alone, searching for kali and \$TOOL
\item Also versions for Raspberry Pi, mobile and other small computers
\end{list1}



\slide{Whois -- Where do IP addresses come from}

\begin{list1}
\item Magical numbers on the internet are administered by IANA \url{https://www.iana.org/}
\item They have handed out portions to the Region Internet Registries (RIR)
\begin{list2}
\item RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens)  \link{http://ripe.net}
\item ARIN American Registry for Internet Numbers \link{http://www.arin.net}
\item Asia Pacific Network Information Center \link{http://www.apnic.net}
\item LACNIC (Regional Latin-American and Caribbean IP Address Registry) - Latin America and some Caribbean Islands
\item AFRINIC \url{https://afrinic.net/}
\end{list2}
\item They are member based, and members are called Local Internet Registries (LIRs) og National Internet Registry (NIR)
\end{list1}

We use the whois program to look up addresses, can be found as web pages too



\slide{Ping}

\begin{list1}
\item Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
\item The ping program works by sending \verb+ICMP ECHO request+ and we
expect an \verb+ICMP ECHO reply+
\item
\begin{alltt}
\small {\bfseries
$ ping 185.129.63.1}
PING 185.129.63.1 (185.129.63.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 185.129.63.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=54 time=8.14 ms
64 bytes from 185.129.63.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=54 time=31.5 ms
64 bytes from 185.129.63.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=54 time=22.4 ms
64 bytes from 185.129.63.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=54 time=12.2 ms
^C
--- 185.129.63.1 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3004ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 8.144/18.544/31.463/9.095 ms
\end{alltt}
\end{list1}

Try it yourself, this should work on most operating systems \verb+ping 185.129.63.1+


\slide{traceroute}

\begin{list2}
\item Another \emph{hacker program} is traceroute -- and I call it that since it uses the Time To Live (TTL) on IPv4 or Hop limit (IPv6) field in packets, not something that was designed as a feature
\item Researcher found that if they sent packets with low TTL and sent it to high numbered UDP ports, they would usually get an answer
\item Routers decrease the TTL counter, and send back ICMP messages, end hosts not listening on a port do the same
\item Traceroute can be done with various protocols, but usually Unix uses UDP and Windows uses ICMP (tracert)
\begin{alltt}
\small{\bfseries
$ traceroute 185.129.63.1}
traceroute to 185.129.63.1 (185.129.63.1),
30 hops max, 40 byte packets
 1  host11 (10.0.0.11)  3.577 ms  0.565 ms  0.323 ms
 2  router (185.129.63.1)  1.481 ms  1.374 ms  1.261 ms
\end{alltt}
\end{list2}

\slide{Hackers don't give a shit}

\hlkrightpic{9cm}{-3cm}{kiwicon-2009-hackers-dont-give-shit.jpg}

Your system is only for testing, development, ...

Your network is a research network, under construction, \\
being phased out, ...

Try something new, go to your management

Bring all the exceptions, all of them, update the risk \\
analysis figures - if this happens it is about 1mill DKK

Ask for permission to go full monty on your security

\slide{Lock Picking}

\hlkimage{4cm}{Lockpicking-Set.jpg}

\begin{quote}\footnotesize
Lock picking is the practice of unlocking a lock by manipulating the components of the lock device without the original key.

Although lock-picking can be associated with criminal intent, it is an essential skill for the legitimate profession of locksmithing, and is also pursued by law-abiding citizens as a useful skill to learn, or simply as a hobby (locksport).

In some countries, such as Japan, lock-picking tools are illegal for most people to possess, but in many others, they are available and legal to own as long as there is no intent to use them for criminal purposes.

\slide{Hacking example -- it is not magic}


{\bf MAC filtering in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks}
\begin{list2}
\item Yes, network card chips have a globally unique MAC address -- from production
\item Access points allow filtering of frames based on MAC
\item Only those matching an allowed list are forwarded -- has access to network
\item The method doesn't work for security though \smiley
\item First, most network cards and drivers allow you to change this MAC easily
\item Second, you can read the allowed ones, as the active systems on the network
\item Further there has been implementation problems in multiple access points
\end{list2}

\slide{Myths about MAC filtering}

The example with MAC filtering is a problematic myth

Why does it happen?
\begin{list2}
\item Marketing -- vendors would like to put as many "security features" on the labels and packages
\item Customer knowledge -- consumers know nothing about the technologies\\
Don't know what a MAC address i, and why should they
\item We are quite few that can understand it, we know what a MAC address is (at least now)
\end{list2}

Solutions
\begin{list2}
\item We must spread information about insecure methods for securing data and systems
\item We must spread information about secure methods for securing data and systems
\item And update our own understanding of those methods, in both groups
\end{list2}

\slide{Network mapping}

\hlkimage{12cm}{images/network-example.pdf}

\begin{list2}
\item Using traceroute, Nping and similar programs you can often discover topoly information about a network
\item Time to Live (TTL) for a packet is decremented for each router it crosses, if set low enough it will time out -- and return ICMP message sent
\item BTW Default Unix traceroute sends UDP packets, Windows tracert send ICMP packets\\
Use tools on Kali to try both protocols, or even others
\end{list2}

\item TCP handshake is easy to see, due to session setup -- services must respond to SYN with SYN-ACK. Otherwise client programs like browsers will not work
\item UDP applications respond differently -- if at all\\
They might respond to queries and probes in the correct format, \\
If no firewall the operating systems will respond with ICMP on closed ports
\item Use Zenmap while learning Nmap
\end{list1}


\slide{TCP three-way handshake}

\hlkimage{45mm}{images/tcp-three-way.pdf}

\begin{list2}
\item {\bfseries TCP SYN half-open} scans
\item In the old days systems would only log a full TCP connection
  -- so a port scanner sending only SYN would be doing a \emph{stealth}-scans. Today we have Intrusion Detection Systems, so a lot of SYN without ever completing the connection is MORE suspicious
\item Note: sending many SYN packets can fill the session table on firewalls, and on servers -- preventing new connections -- also called {\bfseries SYN-flooding}
\end{list2}


\slide{Ping and port sweep}

\begin{list1}
\item Scanning across a network is called sweeping
\item Scans using ICMP ping will be a ping-sweep -- active IPs

\slide{Buffer overflows a C problem}

\begin{list1}
\item {\bfseries A buffer overflow} is what happens when writing more data than allocated in some area of memory. Typically the program will crash, but under certain circumstances an attacker can write structures allowing take over of return addresses, parameters for system calls or program execution.
\item {\bfseries Stack protection} is today used as a generic term for multiple technologies used in operating systems, libraries, compilers etc. that protect the stack and other structures from being overwritten or changed through buffer overflows. StackGuard
and Propolice are examples of this.
\end{list1}

Today we will not go more into detail about this, suffice it to say modern operating systems really employ a lot of methods for making buffer overflows harder and less likely to succeed. OpenBSD even relink the kernel on installation to randomize addresses.

\slide{Privilege Escalation}
\begin{list1}
\item {\bfseries Privilege escalation} is when a privileged program is vulnerable and can be abused to escalate privileges. Example from unauthenticated user to a user account, or from regular user and becoming administrator (root on Unix) or even SYSTEM on Windows.
\item Kernels and drivers are also often susceptible to this

\item {\bfseries Local vs. remote} exploit describe if the attack is done over some network, or locally on a system

are the worst kind, since they work over the network, and gives complete control aka root on Unix
\item {\bfseries Zero-day exploits} is a term used for those exploits that suddenly pop up, without previous warning. Often found during incident response at some network. We prefer that security researchers that discover a vulnerability uses a {\bf responsible disclosure} process that involves the vendor .

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{python}
vxlanport=4789     # RFC 7384 port 4789, Linux kernel default 8472
vni=37             # Usually VNI == destination VLAN
vxlan=Ether(dst=routermac)/IP(src=vtepsrc,dst=vtepdst)/
   UDP(sport=vxlanport,dport=vxlanport)/VXLAN(vni=vni,flags="Instance")
broadcastmac="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"
randommac="00:51:52:01:02:03"
attacker="185.27.115.666"
destination="10.0.0.10"
# port is the one we want to contact inside the firewall
insideport=53
testport=54040
packet=vxlan/Ether(dst=broadcastmac,src=randommac)/IP(src=attacker,
    dst=destination)/UDP(sport=testport,dport=insideport)/
    DNS(rd=1,id=0xdead,qd=DNSQR(qname="www.wikipedia.org"))
\end{minted}

{\footnotesize Fun fact, Unbound on OpenBSD reply to DNS requests received in Ethernet packets with broadcast destination and IP destination being the IP of the server}



\slide{Send and receive - from another source}

Send and then wait for something, not from same IP bc from\\
inside NAT, but port should be OK
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{python}
pid = os.fork()
if pid:
    print "parent: setting up sniffing"
    # Wait for UDP packet
    data = sniff(filter="udp and port 54040 and net 192.0.2.0/24", count=1)
else:
    time.sleep(10)
    print "child: sending packet"
    sendp(packet,loop=0)
    print "child: closing"
    sys.exit(0)
data[0].show()
\end{minted}

Source port in the inside request packet, becomes the destination port in replies from the server - 54040

\begin{list2}
\item Run each test for at least 5 minutes, or even 15 minutes\\
Some attacks require some build-up before resource run out
\item Take note of any change in response, higher latency, lost probes
\item If you see a change, then re-test using the same parameters, or a little less first
\item We want to know the approximate level where it breaks
\item If you want to change environment, then wait until all scenarios are tested
\item Keep a log handy, write notes and start the session with \verb+script ddos-date-customer.log+
\item Check once in a while if you have some process running, using \verb+ps auxw | grep hping3+
\item Run multiple instances of the tools. One process might generate 800.000 pps, while two may double it. Though 10 processes might not be 10 times exactly

\slide{Concrete advice for enterprise networks}


\begin{list2}
\item Portscanning - start using portscans in your networks, verify how far malware and hackers can travel, and identify soft systems needing updates or isolation
\item Have separation -- anywhere, starting with organisation units, management networks, server networks, customers, guests, LAN, WAN, Mail, web, ...
\item Use Web proxies - do not allow HTTP directly except for a short allow list, \\
do not allow traffic to and from any new TLD
\item Use only your own DNS servers, create a pair of Unbound servers, \\
point your internal DNS running on Windows to these\\
Create filtering, logging, restrictions on these Unbound DNS servers\\
\link{https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/} and also \link{https://pi-hole.net/}
\item Only allow SMTP via your own mail servers, create a simple forwarder if you must
\end{list2}

Allow lists are better than block list, even if it takes some time to do it

\slide{Capture data and logs!}


\begin{list2}
\item Run DNS query logs -- when client1 is infected with malware from domain malwareexample.com, then search for more clients i
nfected
\item Run Zeek and gather information about all HTTPS sessions -- captures certificates by default, and we can again search for
certificate related to malwareexample.com
\item Run network logging -- session logs in enterprise networks are GREAT \\
(country wide illegal logging is of course NOT)
\end{list2}

Make sure to check with employees, inform them!

\slide{DROP SOME TRAFFIC NOW}

\begin{list2}
\item Drop some traffic on the border of everything
\item Seriously do NOT allow Windows RPC across borders
\item Border here may be from regional country office back to HQ
\item Border may be from internet to internal networks
\item Block Windows RPC ports, 135, 137, 139, 445
\item Block DNS directly to internet, do not allow clients to use any DNS, fake 8.8.8.8 if you must internally
\item Block SMTP directly to internet
\item Create allow list for internal networks, client networks should not contact other client networks but only relevant server networks
\end{list2}

You DONT need to allow direct DNS towards internet, except from your own recursive DNS servers

If you get hacked by Windows RPC in 2022, you probably deserve it, sorry for being blunt

Best would be to analyze traffic and create allow lists, some internal networks to not need internet at all

\slide{Default permit}

%\hlkimage{}{}

One of the early implementers of firewalls Marcus J. Ranum summarized in 2005 The Six Dumbest Ideas in Computer Security \link{https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/} which includes the always appropriate discussion about default permit versus default deny.

\begin{quote}\small {\bf
\#1) Default Permit}\\
This dumb idea crops up in a lot of different forms; it’s incredibly persistent and difficult to eradicate. Why? Because it’s so attractive. Systems based on ”Default Permit” are the computer security equivalent of empty calories: tasty, yet fattening.

The most recognizable form in which the ”Default Permit” dumb idea manifests itself is in firewall rules. Back in the very early days of computer security, network managers would set up an internet connection and decide to secure it by turning off incoming telnet, incoming rlogin, and incoming FTP. Everything else was allowed through, hence the name ”Default Permit.” This put the security practitioner in an endless arms-race with the hackers.
\end{quote}


\begin{list2}

\slide{We cannot do X}

\begin{quote}
We cannot block SMTP from internal networks, since we do not know for sure if vendor X equipment needs to send the MOST important email alert at some unspecific time in the future
\end{quote}

Cool, then we can do an allow list starting today on our border firewall:
\begin{alltt}
table <smtp-exchange> \{ $exchange1 $exchange2 $exchange3 \}
table <smtp-unknown> persist file "/firewall/mail/smtp-internal-unknown.txt"
# Regular use, allowed
pass out on egress inet proto tcp from smtp-echange to any port 25/tcp
# Unknown, remove when phased out
pass out on egress inet proto tcp from smtp-internal to any port 25/tcp
\end{alltt}

Year 0 the unknown list may be 100\% of all internal networks, but new networks added to infrastructure are NOT added, so list will shrink -- evaluate the list, and compare to network logs, did networks send ANY SMTP for 1,2,3 years?

\slide{Firewall -- Another definition}

% Remove?
I am also fond of this longer and technical definition from RFC4949:
\begin{quote}
\$ firewall

      1. (I) {\bf An internetwork gateway that restricts data communication
      traffic to and from one of the connected networks} (the one said to
      be "inside" the firewall) and thus protects that network's system
      resources against threats from the other network (the one that is
      said to be "outside" the firewall). (See: guard, security
      gateway.)

      2. (O) {\bf A device or system that controls the flow of traffic
      between networks using differing security postures.} Wack, J. et al (NIST), "Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy", Special Publication 800-41,
      January 2002.

      Tutorial: A firewall typically protects a smaller, secure network
      (such as a corporate LAN, or even just one host) from a larger
      network (such as the Internet). The firewall is installed at the
      point where the networks connect, and the firewall applies policy
      rules to control traffic that flows in and out of the protected
      network.
\end{quote}

\slide{Firewall -- Another definition}
% Remove?
\begin{quote}
\$ firewall, continued

      {\bf A firewall is not always a single computer.} For example, a
      firewall may consist of a pair of filtering routers and one or
      more proxy servers running on one or more bastion hosts, all
      connected to a small, dedicated LAN (see: buffer zone) between the
      two routers.

      The external router blocks attacks that use IP to
      break security (IP address spoofing, source routing, packet
      fragments), while proxy servers block attacks that would exploit a
      vulnerability in a higher-layer protocol or service. The internal
      router blocks traffic from leaving the protected network except
      through the proxy servers.

      The difficult part is defining criteria by which packets are denied passage through the firewall, because
      a firewall not only needs to keep unauthorized traffic (i.e., intruders) out, but usually also needs to let authorized traffic
      pass both in and out.
