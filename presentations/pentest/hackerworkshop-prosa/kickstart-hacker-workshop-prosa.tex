This material is prepared for use in \emph{\subject} It contains the very basic information to get started!

This workshop and exercises are expected to be performed in a training setting with network connected systems. The exercises use a number of open source tools which can be copied and reused after training.

To get kickstarted in this workshop it is recommended to perform the following:
\begin{list2}

\item[\faSquareO] {\bf Download and install Nmap}\\
We will use Nmap as the main tool \link{https://nmap.org/download.html} this package is easily installed on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.\\
Note: The tool Nmap is an advanced portscanner and \emph{may} be flagged by your anti-virus program. Usually that is a good thing, we don't want anyone inside an organisation to do port scans, only authorized administrators. The tool itself is NOT malware.
\item[\faSquareO] {\bf Download slides and exercises booklet}\\
Recommend downloading latest version at the beginning of the workshop. Get main slides and exercises PDF from\\
\link{https://github.com/kramse/security-courses/tree/master/presentations/pentest/hackerworkshop-prosa}
\item[\faSquareO] {\bf Join the Pentest Wi-Fi network: SSID pentest}\\
I brought my own network for this workshop, where we can scan and perform things which are not recommended on the PROSA Wi-Fi
\end{list2}

You don't {\bf need} a virtual machine for the workshop, but if you want to do more advanced pentesting after the workshop it is recommended to install a Kali virtual machine:
\begin{list2}
\item[\faSquareO]  Read my recommendations about setup of virtual systems here\\ \link{https://github.com/kramse/kramse-labs}
\end{list2}


I hope we will have a fun and enjoyable time in this workshop.
